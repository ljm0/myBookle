        "abstract": "When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.<br /><br />Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.<br /><br />Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle\u2014the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.<br /><br />Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle\u2019s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord\u2019s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore\u2019s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry\u2019s\u2014and Hogwarts\u2019s\u2014future in shadow.<br /><br />Source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://harrypotter.scholastic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://harrypotter.scholastic.com</a>"

Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?<br /><br />Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named---a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.<br /><br />As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable sacrifice.<br /><br />His fate depends on them all."

But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br /><br />After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.<br /><br />Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come."

        "abstract": "The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br /><br />And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone, or something, starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects: Harry Potter himself?"

        "abstract": "Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.<br />--scholastic.com"

He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly. --back cover"

Together they stick out their thumbs to the stars and begin a wild journey through time and space.<br /><br />\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\"<br /><br />Facing annihilation at the hands of warmongers is a curious time to crave tea. It could only happen to the cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his comrades as they hurtle across the galaxy in a desperate search for a place to eat.<br /><br />\"Life, the Universe and Everything\"<br /><br />The unhappy inhabitants of planet Krikkit are sick of looking at the night sky- so they plan to destroy it. The universe, that is. Now only five individuals can avert Armageddon: mild-mannered Arthur Dent and his stalwart crew.<br /><br />\"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\"<br /><br />Back on Earth, Arthur Dent is ready to believe that the past eight years were all just a figment of his stressed-out imagination. But a gift-wrapped fishbowl with a cryptic inscription conspires to thrust him back to reality. So to speak.<br /><br />\"Mostly Harmless\"<br /><br />Just when Arthur Dent makes the terrible mistake of starting to enjoy life, all hell breaks loose. Can he save the Earth from total obliteration? Can he save the Guide from a hostile alien takeover? Can he save his daughter from herself?<br /><br />Also includes the short story \"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\"."

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world\u2019s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining."

        "abstract": "In the early fall of 2002, famed travel Writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption."

His previous excursion along the Appalachian Trail resulted in the sublime national bestseller <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>. <i>In A Sunburned Country</i> is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book. Australia is an immense and fortunate land, and it has found in Bill Bryson its perfect guide."

        "abstract": "After living in Britain for two decades, Bill Bryson recently moved back to the United States with his English wife and four children (he had read somewhere that nearly 3 million Americans believed they had been abducted by aliens--as he later put it, \"it was clear my people needed me\"). They were greeted by a new and improved America that boasts microwave pancakes, twenty-four-hour dental-floss hotlines, and the staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item. <br /><br />Delivering the brilliant comic musings that are a Bryson hallmark, I'm a Stranger Here Myself recounts his sometimes disconcerting reunion with the land of his birth. The result is a book filled with hysterical scenes of one man's attempt to reacquaint himself with his own country, but it is also an extended if at times bemused love letter to the homeland he has returned to after twenty years away."

After ten years in England, he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of trim and sunny place where the films of his youth were set. Instead, his search led him to Anywhere, USA; a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by lookalike people with a penchant for synthetic fibres. Travelling around thirty-eight of the lower states - united only in their mind-numbingly dreary uniformity - he discovered a continent that was doubly lost; lost to itself because blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a stranger in his own land.<br /><br />The Lost Continent is a classic of travel literature - hilariously, stomach-achingly funny, yet tinged with heartache - and the book that first staked Bill Bryson's claim as the most beloved writer of his generation."

        "abstract": "Bill Bryson's first travel book, <i>The Lost Continent</i>, was unanimously acclaimed as one of the funniest books in years. In <i>Neither Here nor There</i> he brings his unique brand of humour to bear on Europe as he shoulders his backpack, keeps a tight hold on his wallet, and journeys from Hammerfest, the northernmost town on the continent, to Istanbul on the cusp of Asia. Fluent in, oh, at least one language, he retraces his travels as a student twenty years before.<br /><br />Whether braving the homicidal motorist of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant, window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations. He even goes to Liechtenstein."

(\"I had recently read,\" Bryson writes, \"that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, so it was clear that my people needed me.\") But before departing, he set out on a grand farewell tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home.<br /><br />Veering from the ludicrous to the endearing and back again, <i>Notes from a Small Island</i> is a delightfully irreverent jaunt around the unparalleled floating nation that has produced zebra crossings, Shakespeare, Twiggie Winkie's Farm, and places with names like Farleigh Wallop and Titsey. The result is an uproarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain, from the satiric pen of an unapologetic Anglophile."

        "abstract": "With dazzling wit and astonishing insight, Bill Bryson\u2014the acclaimed author of <em>The Lost Continent</em>\u2014brilliantly explores the remarkable history, eccentricities, resilience and sheer fun of the English language. From the first descent of the larynx into the throat (why you can talk but your dog can't), to the fine lost art of swearing, Bryson tells the fascinating, often uproarious story of an inadequate, second-rate tongue of peasants that developed into one of the world's largest growth industries."

Lewis proclaimed, \u201clike lightning from a clear sky.\u201d Fifty years and nearly one hundred million American readers later comes a beautiful new one-volume collector\u2019s edition befitting the stature of this crown jewel of our list. With a text fully corrected under the supervision of Christopher Tolkien to meet the author\u2019s exacting wishes, two large-format fold-out maps, a ribbon placemarker, gilded page edges, a color insert depicting Tolkien's own paintings of the Book of Mazarbul and exceptionally elegant and sturdy overall packaging housed within an attractive slipcase, this edition is the finest we\u2019ve ever produced."

But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit.<br /><br />In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.<br />--back cover"

From the graceful and proficient Elves to the horrendous war machines of the Dark Lord, each culture's approach to warfare is explained - how they fought, why they were fighting, what armor they wore and what weapons they used against their enemies. Now you can get as close to a marauding Orc as you could ever wish, without suffering the consequences!</p><p>Treating the filmmakers' notes, designs and props as a true archive, Weapons and Warfare describes in detail every major conflict depicted in the film trilogy - from The Last Alliance of Elves and Men to the climactic Battle of the Pelennor Fields - each accompanied by a battle diagram from the films' chief designers.</p><p>Armed with a wealth of fascinating facts and unique imagery, and with an exclusive foreword by Christopher Lee and an introduction by the Academy Award winner Richard Taylor, Weapons and Warfare promises to be the most striking companion to The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy published to date.</p>"

Along the way our heroes will encounter Elves and Ents, Uruk-hai and Orcs, Trolls, and Haradrim on their towering war-elephants, the mumakil. The Companion introduces readers to the monstrous Shelob the spider, to the Corsairs of Umbar, and to that pitiful but deadly creature Gollum.<br /><br />This omnibus edition also includes brand-new sections appearing in print for the first time, which take the story of the quest of the Fellowship beyond Mount Doom, all the way to the hearbreaking finale at the Grey Havens."

        "abstract": "A three-volume boxed set edition of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic The Lord of the Rings, featuring film act on the cover. The set includes The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King.<br /><br />In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, The Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth still it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell, by chance, into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.<br /><br />From his fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, Sauron's power spread far and wide. He gathered all the Great Rings to him, but ever he searched far and wide for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.<br /><br />On his eleventy-first birthday, Bilbo disappeared bequeathing to his young cousin, Frodo, the Ruling Ring, and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the wizard, Merry, Pippin and Sam, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Boromir of Gondor, and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.<br /><br />Saga of a group heroes who set forth to save their world from evil. A brotherhood of 'hobbits,' elves, dwarves, and people is formed to combat evil forces. Tolkien drew on his extensive knowledge of folklore and the classics to create the worlds and creatures described in the trilogy, which includes The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King."

Gerald's idyll is shattered by the arrival of Marta, on the run from a crime-riddled former soviet republic. A series of hilarious misunderstandings brings this odd couple into ever closer and more disastrous proximity.<br /><br />James Hamilton-Paterson's first novel, \"Gerontius,\" won the Whitbread Award.

        "abstract": "Rails is a full-stack, open source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications, but with a twist... A full Rails application probably has less total code than the XML you'd need to configure the same application in other frameworks. With this book you'll learn how to use \"ActiveRecord\" to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the \"Action Pack\" framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and scaling. You'll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice (such as Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web server. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all. You'll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full Rails application is developed---iteratively and rapidly. Rails strives to honor the Pragmatic Programmer's \"DRY Principle\" by avoiding the extra work of configuration files and code annotations. You can develop in real-time: make a change, and watch it work immediately. Forget XML. Everything in Rails, from templates to control flow to business logic, is written in Ruby, the language of choice for programmers who like to get the job done well (and leave work ontime for a change). Rails is the framework of choice for the new generation of Web 2.0 developers. Agile Web Development with Rails is the book for that generation, written by Dave Thomas (Pragmatic Programmer and author of Programming Ruby) and David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Rails."

The combination of Ruby and Ruby on Rails provides a simple, stable platform for cost-effective software development.<br /><br />The book quickly reviews Rails development and then move to essential enterprise subjects like Web Services (and their relationships with SOA), data persistence, messaging, interoperability with other platforms, handling documents and search, spell-checking, and report generation. It also covers new Web 2.0 technologies like Ajax and the read-write Web. It is rich in examples and covers numerous interesting topics readers will be surprised to see, such as advanced search with Ferret, how to access del.icio.us and Flickr from Ruby, or how to use Yahoo's general search from Ruby. The book closes with a look at the Semantic Web and why it makes sense to adopt semantic Web technologies."

        "abstract": "Brian is on his way to Canada to visit his estranged father when the pilot of his small prop plane suffers a heart attack. Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. <br /><br />Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone. Exhausted, terrified, and hungry, Brian struggles to find food and make a shelter for himself. He has no special knowledge of the woods, and he must find a new kind of awareness and patience as he meets each day's challenges. Is the water safe to drink? Are the berries he finds poisonous? <br /><br />Slowly, Brian learns to turn adversity to his advantage--an invading porcupine unexpectedly shows him how to make fire, a devastating tornado shows him how to retrieve supplies from the submerged airplane. Most of all, Brian leaves behind the self-pity he has felt about his predicament as he summons the courage to stay alive. <br /><br />A story of survival and of transformation, this riveting book has sparked many a reader's interest in venturing into the wild."

In \"Guts\", Gary tells the real stories behind the Brian books, the stories of the adventures that inspired him to write Brian Robeson's story: working as an emergency volunteer; the death that inspired the pilot's death in \"Hatchet\"; plane crashes he has seen and near-misses of his own. He describes how he made his own bows and arrows, and takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes. He shares special memories, such as the night he attracted every mosquito in the county, or how he met the moose with a sense of humor, and the moose who made it personal. There's a handy chapter on \"Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition\". Recipes included. Readers may wonder how Gary Paulsen survived to write all of his books -- well, it took guts."

Novelists have forfeited a wider audience, succumbing to identity politicking and self-reflexive postmodernism. In the torrent of responses to this fulguration, opinions were not so much divided as cleaved in two with, for example, Carlin Romano contending that \u201cPeck\u2019s judgments are worse than nasty\u2014they are hysterical\u201d and Benjamin Schwarz retorting that \u201cin his meticulous attention to diction, his savage wit, his exact and rollicking prose and his disdain for pseudointellectual flatulence, Dale Peck is Mencken\u2019s heir.\u201d<br /><br /><i>Hatchet Jobs</i> includes swinging critiques of the work of, among others, Sven Birkerts, Julian Barnes, Philip Roth, Colson Whitehead, Jim Crace, Stanley Crouch, and Rick Moody.<br /><br /><br />"

There was something wonderful about her. Ivy explained it by saying that she was a changeling, a child of supernatural parents who had been exchanged for the real Ivy Carson at birth. This classic book was first published in 1970. It was awarded a Christopher Medal and named an outstanding book for young people by the Junior Library Guild."

        "abstract": "<div>\n  <div>A ten year veteran of the Providence Rhode Island vice squad Gwen \"GiGi\" Gellman began her life as a foundling and is used to being on her own. So when she finds herself unemployed and on the outs after a standard bust goes bad resulting in a bloodbath, she welcomes the occasion to break from routine. She scrapes together enough capital to start her own PI business specializing in \"family problems.\" But, in doing so she never guessed that she would uncover her own mysterious and mystical past.<br /><br />When GiGi becomes involved in the case of a missing wife and child, she initially dismisses the matter as good sense on the wife's part--she knows the husband to be less than stellar in his role. But, as her investigation progresses GiGi discovers a pattern of lies and deceptions, some of which expose hidden ties to her own mystifying existence. <br /><br />Otherworldly powers try to intercede, and soon GiGi finds not only her own life threatened, but those of her friends and family as well.</div>\n</div>"

        "abstract": "Rebecca Mandeville<br /><br />The story of <em>The Changeling</em> is told by Angelet's daughter, Rebecca, who was born in Benedict Lansdon's grandfather's house in an Australian gold-mining township. Before Rebecca was born, her father had died saving another man's life. She had always looked up to him as a great hero and when she heard that her mother was to marry Benedict Lansdon, she was deeply shocked.<br /><br />The prolific British author of historical romances (<em>The Pool of St. Branok</em>) continues her lavishly entwined narrative of the families connected to Benedict Lansdon, now a recently bereaved widower, absentee father and wealthy seeker of a Parliament seat. Narrated by Benedict's aggrieved stepdaughter, Rebecca, this complex tale of love and betrayal concerns a three-cornered sibling relationship involving Rebecca, her half-sister, Belinda, and Lucie, a country waif informally adopted by Rebecca. Aware that her father blames her for her mother's death in childbirth, Belinda takes refuge in michievous behavior. Placid Lucie, however, fits in well with the family, though her lineage is suspect and clouded with mysterious events at St. Branok's pool. Although Belinda seems the most obvious \"changeling\", Carr sustains an air of doubt and intrigue. The ambience of the Cornish countryside and of Victorian London permeate this piquantly Gothic family saga."

Jones.<br /><br /><i>The Known World</i> tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order, and chaos ensues. Jones has woven a footnote of history into an epic that takes an unflinching look at slavery in all its moral complexities."

        "abstract": "Warren Buffett once memorably described derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Read this sensational and controversial account of the often dazzling business of derivatives trading, and see if you agree.<br /><br />No money is ever really made in financial markets. Markets merely transfer wealth. As to <i>how</i> to make money? Well, it is basically theft, misrepresentation, lies, cheating, deception or force. It is impossible to make the staggering amounts made in derivatives in good years honestly.<br /><br /><i>Traders, Guns &amp; Money </i>is a wry and wickedly comic expos\u00e9 of the culture, games, and pure deceptions played out every day in trading rooms around the world, usually with other people's money. Whether you move in the financial world yourself, know people who do, or have money invested in stocks, shares or derivatives, this is a fascinating read guaranteed to make you think."

Includes an expansive adaptation of R. Talsorian Games' LifePath character-generation system including birth omens, star signs and divine and heroic lineages, and rules for talents and abilities accessible to characters through the Arcana, the Tarot-like system representing the Known World's archetypal paths of power and the foundation of an unique system of experience, allowing game rewards for virtually all types of character actions."

In 1965, John McPhee published his first book, <i>A Sense of Where You Are</i>; a decade later, he had published eleven others. His fertility, his precision and grace as a stylist, his wit and uncanny brilliance in choosing subject matter, his crack storytelling skills have made him into one of our best writers: a journalist whom L.E. Sissman ranked with Liebling and Mencken, who Geoffrey Wolff said \"is bringing his work to levels that have no measurable limit,\" who has been called \"a master craftsman\" so many times that it is pointless to number them."

Here, at his adventurous best, he is out and about with people who work in freight transportation.</b><br /><br /><br />Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent considerable time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. <i>Uncommon Carriers </i>is his sketchbook of them and of his journeys with them. He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, <br />eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the \"tight-assed\" Illinois River on a<br />\"towboat\" pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being \"a good deal longer than the <i>Titanic</i>.\" And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, <br />in a homemade skiff in 1839.<br /><br /><i>Uncommon Carriers </i>is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author's warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character."

        "abstract": "<i>Heirs of General Practice </i>is a frieze of glimpses of young doctors with patients of every age\u2014about a dozen physicians in all, who belong to the new medical specialty called family practice. They are people who have addressed themselves to a need for a unifying generalism in a world that has become greatly subdivided by specialization, physicians who work with the \"unquantifiable idea that a doctor who treats your grandmother, your father, your niece, and your daughter will be more adroit in treating you.\"<br /><br />These young men and women are seen in their examining rooms in various rural communities in Maine, but Maine is only the example. Their medical objectives, their successes, the professional obstacles they do and do not overcome are representative of any place family practitioners are working. While essential medical background is provided, McPhee's masterful approach to a trend significant to all of us is replete with affecting, and often amusing, stories about both doctors and their charges."

        "abstract": "While John McPhee was working on his previous book, <i>Rising from the Plains</i>, he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: \"Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given.\" In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--\"the control of nature\"--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity. Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) \"any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods.\" His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control.<br /><br />In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is.<br /><br />In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers.<br /><br />Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris.<br /><br />Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.<br />"

The structure of the book never changed, but its breadth caused him to complete it in stages, under the overall title <i>Annals of the Former World</i>.<br /><br />Like the terrain it covers, <i>Annals of the Former World</i> tells a multilayered tale, and the reader may choose one of many paths through it. As clearly and succinctly written as it is profoundly informed, this is our finest popular survey of geology and a masterpiece of modern nonfiction.<br /><br /><i>Annals of the Former World </i>is the winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction."

You are something wonderful, you are\u2014people of the city\u2014and we, who are almost without exception strangers here, are as absorbed with you as you seem to be with the numbers on our hanging scales.\" So opens the title piece in this collection of John McPhee's classic essays, grouped here with four others, including \"Brigade de Cuisine,\" a profile of an artistic and extraordinary chef; \"The Keel of Lake Dickey,\" in which a journey down the whitewater of a wild river ends in the shadow of a huge projected dam; a report on plans for the construction of nuclear power plants that would float in the ocean; and a pinball shoot-out between two prizewinning journalists."

I raise that semaphore here at the start so no one will feel misled by an opening passage in which a slim young woman who is not in any sense a geologist steps down from a train in Rawlins, Wyoming, in order to go north by stagecoach into country that was still very much the Old West.</i><br /><br />So begins John McPhee's <i>Rising from the Plains.</i> If you like to read about geology, you will find good reading here. If, on the other hand, you are not much engaged by the spatial complexities of the science, you could miss a richness of human history that has its place among the strata described. Sometimes it is said of geologists that they reflect in their professional styles the sort of country in which they grew up. Nowhere could that be more true than in the life of a geologist born in the center of Wyoming and raised on an isolated ranch. This is the story of that ranch, soon after the turn of the century, and of the geologist who grew up there, at home with the composition of the high country in the way that someone growing up in a coastal harbor would be at home with the vagaries of the sea. While <i>Rising from the Plains</i> is a portrayal of extraordinary people, it is also a history of the landscape around them, where, with remarkable rapidity, mountains came up out of the flat terrain. Gradually, the mountains were buried, until only the higher peaks remained above a vast plain. Recently, they have been exhumed, and they stand now as the Rockies. <br /><br /><i>Rising from the Plains</i> is John McPhee's third book on geology and geologists. Following <i>Basin and Range</i> and <i>In Suspect Terrain,</i> it continues to present a cross section of North America along the fortieth parallel\u2014a series gathering under the overall title <i>Annals of the Former World.</i><br /><br /><i>Description from the first-edition dust jacket (1986). </i>"

        "abstract": "Comprised of a series of interrelated scenes, the play traces the coming of age of Heidi Holland, a successful art historian, as she tries to find her bearings in a rapidly changing world. Gradually distancing herself from her friends, she watches them move from the idealism and political radicalism of their college years through militant feminism and, eventually, back to the materialism that they had sought to reject in the first place. Heidi's own path to maturity involves an affair with the glib, arrogant Scoop Rosenbaum, a womanizing lawyer/publisher who eventually marries for money and position; a deeper but even more troubling relationship with a charming, witty young pediatrician, Peter Patrone, who turns out to be gay; and increasingly disturbing contacts with the other women, now much changed, who were a part of her childhood and college years. Eventually Heidi comes to accept the fact that liberation can be achieved only if one is true to oneself, with goals that come out of need rather than circumstance. As the play ends she is still \"alone,\" but having adopted an orphaned baby, it is clear that she has begun to find a sense of fulfillment and continuity that may well continue to elude the others of her anxious, self-centered generation."

His love and power have no limits-and that's a message readers from all walks of life need to hear. The modern miracles that Rolland and Heidi Baker experience every day in their work with Mozambique's throwaway children, movingly chronicled in Always Enough, will inspire anyone looking for hope in the midst of suffering. <br />\tThe Bakers, formerly missionaries in Indonesia and Hong Kong, share how their work for the past eight years in Mozambique, one of the poorest nations on earth, has borne spiritual fruit beyond their wildest dreams. Every day presents multiple impossible needs. But in the face of everything Satan can do, as Rolland and Heidi lay down their lives and \"minister to the one,\" there is always enough. <br />\tReaders will discover that the simple practice of choosing to step out and trust God every day unleashes his provision for every need."

It sorts lessons and units into consistent plans that teachers, schools, and districts can access to ensure content is consistent and also progresses along with students. Jacobs and her contributors describe how to set up a mapping project, work on the project as a team, and use mapping in special settings such as in an independent or alternative school. They show how to create consistent benchmarks and use the resulting maps to integrate new technology, new data, decision-making structures, and staff development opportunities. The appendices include samples.<br /><br />Preparing educators to implement mapping procedures, <br />* Using software to create unique mapping databases, <br />* Integrating decision-making structures and staff development initiatives through mapping, <br />* Helping school communities adjust to new curriculum review processes, and <br />* Making mapping an integral part of literacy training."

Though his carnal lips tempted Rebecca beyond reason, she couldn't afford to love a man like Caleb. For the price might be another fatherless babe....<br /><br />Why, Caleb mused, would he be drawn to a calico-clad dressmaker when sirens in silk were his for the asking? Still, innocent Rebecca unaccountably stirred him. Left him indifferent to costly perfumes. Made him crave her simpler scents of cinnamon and roses. Caleb vowed to trust no woman with his heart.

        "abstract": "Today in one of Southern Africa's most disaster-torn nations, Rolland and Heidi Baker are at the center of a major move of God's Spirit. The last four years have seen them plant and take responsibility for around 6,000 churches as thousands of Mozambiquans have given their lives to Christ in an unprecedented revival. During this time, they have also witnessed numerous acts of God's power. Miracles of provision, healing, deliverance, and even raising the dead, have become every day occurrences. This adventure began when Rolland and Heidi Baker, founders of IRIS Ministries, and both natives of California, USA, answered God's call to minister to the poorest of the poor. Rolland describes this best in the introduction to the forthcoming book that tells the story, \" There's Always Enough\". In his introduction to the book, Rolland Baker says: \"Jesus developed our faith over the years in many countries and ministry situations for a reason. Today He has given us oversight over five thousand churches in one of the poorest areas of the world. We live in Mozambique, in the south-east corner of Africa, a land that has suffered horribly from decades of warfare and natural disaster. Finally the people are desperate for Jesus and no other. Revival is spreading. In large sections of central Mozambique and southern Malawi we have simple, mud-hut churches in virtually every village. They grow until there are as many as can hear the sound of a preacher's voice.\" \"More are being added continuously, and now others in countries around us are calling for ministry and help, desperate to be a part of this fire. The gospel of Jesus Christ is enough for them all. He is good and faithful,the Master Lover. They just want Him. They have been poor and wretched, but now they possess all things in Him. We dare to approach them, we dare to preach to them, we dare to pick up the helpless, abandoned and dying, because He died for us and rose again on our behalf. We eat and drink from His body and blood, and as a result, there will always be enough...\""

        "abstract": "<b>Everyone knows Frank Herbert's Dune.</b><br /><br />This amazing and complex epic, combining politics, religion, human evolution, and ecology, has captured the imagination of generations of readers. One of the most popular science fiction novels ever written, it has become a worldwide phenomenon, winning awards, selling millions of copies around the world. In the prophetic year of 1984, <i>Dune</i> was made into a motion picture directed by David Lynch, and it has recently been produced as a three-part miniseries on the Sci-Fi Channel. Though he is best remembered for <i>Dune</i>, Frank Herbert was the author of more than twenty books at the time of his tragic death in 1986, including such classic novels as <i>The Green Brain, The Santaroga Barrier, The White Plague</i> and <i>Dosadi Experiment</i>.<br /><br />Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's eldest son, tells the provocative story of his father's extraordinary life in this honest and loving chronicle. He has also brought to light all the events in Herbert's life that would find their way into speculative fiction's greatest epic.<br /><br />From his early years in Tacoma, Washington, and his education at the University of Washington, Seattle, and in the Navy, through the years of trying his hand as a TV cameraman, radio commentator, reporter, and editor of several West Coast newspaper, to the difficult years of poverty while struggling to become a published writer, Herbert worked long and hard before finding success after the publication of <i>Dune</i> in 1965. Brian Herbert writes about these years with a truthful intensity that brings every facet of his father's brilliant, and sometimes troubled, genius to full light.<br /><br />Insightful and provocative, containing family photos never published anywhere, this absorbing biography offers Brian Herbert' unique personal perspective on one of the most enigmatic and creative talents of our time.<br /><br /><i>Dreamer of Dune</i> is a 2004 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Related Work."

The Road to Dune </i>also includes some of the original correspondence between Frank Herbert and famed editor John W. Campbell, Jr., along with other correspondence during Herbert's years-long struggle to get his innovative work published, and the article \"They Stopped the Moving Sands,\" Herbert's original inspiration for <i>Dune.</i><br /><br /><i>The Road to Dune </i>also features newly discovered papers and manuscripts of Frank Herbert, and <i>Spice Planet,</i> an original novel by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, based on a detailed outline left by Frank Herbert.<br /><br /><i>The Road to Dune </i>is a treasure trove of essays, articles, and fiction that every reader of <i>Dune</i> will want to add to their shelf."

His childhood is marked by humiliation and abandonment, yet he vows to survive and conceives heroic dreams, which are nothing compared to what life actually has in store for him. He embarks on an epic journey through a land of tribal superstition and modern prejudice where he will learn the power of words, the power to transform lives and the power of one."

        "abstract": "The life of civil rights leader Daisy Bates is vividly detailed in this stirring new biography by an acclaimed husband-wife team. Throughout her life, Daisy Bates worked tirelessly for civil rights as an activist, journalist, and organizer. She first captured national attention as the mentor of the nine black students who integrated Central High School in Little Rock in 1957. During this crisis President Dwight Eisenhower was forced to use federal troops to insure the admission of the students, who became known as the Little Rock Nine. In 1999, just hours after her funeral, President Bill Clinton bestowed the Congressional Gold Medal on the Little Rock Nine, and two years later Daisy Bates was honored by a state holiday in Arkansas.<br />In this noteworthy companion to their other distinguished biographies of African Americans, Dennis and Judith Fradin have drawn upon a trove of archival material including papers, correspondence, and photographs of her life and work. They also interviewed some of her living relatives and members of the Little Rock Nine. The result is a compelling, inspiring book about the courage and determination of one woman in the face of prejudice and intolerance. Endnotes, bibliography, index.<br />"

Maxwell demonstrates how we can live with integrity by using the Golden Rule as our standard-in business and in life. In fact, Maxwell suggests the higher standard of exceeding the Golden Rule-by treating people better than they treat us, helping those who cannot help us, doing right when it is natural to do wrong, and keeping promises, even when it hurts.<br /><br />An ethics guide for any situation, each \"day\" of The Power of One offers a Drilling Down section which features a case study or story that illustrates the day's topic, Summarizing Principles on the subject, penetrating questions for Making Evaluation, and points of application for Taking Action. Maxwell reveals the factors that can \"tarnish\" the Golden Rule and teaches how to develop the Midas touch in personal integrity."

Its been known to make men turn championship wrestling off, large women in double knit polyester slacks dance, and derelict children smile. That's why Ruby Ann has taken the time to write down her favorite recipes in an easy to read cookbook (The Down Home Trailer Park Cookbook; A Twister Of Tasty Treats).<br /><br />This cookbook gives the reader a titillating guide to handed down recipes and an insider's look at Ruby Ann's fellow residents at the 20 lot \"High Chaparral Trailer Park\" in Pangburn, Arkansas. Along with good food and gossip, the reader will come face to face with sex, murder, topless dancing, Baptist ministers, adultery, and political secrets. The fact that Ruby Ann Boxcar has lived her entire life in a trailer, and her updo hairstyle, cat eyed glasses, and blue eye shadow insures the reader she knows what she's talking about when it comes to trailer park living. Her 300-pound figure speaks for itself on the question of her cooking credentials."

        "abstract": "From Publishers Weekly:<br /><br />Free of the restraints of haute cuisine, the Michelin guide and roofed kitchens in general, Boxcar weighs in with highly entertaining recipes and helpless hints, straight from her double-wide trailer at the High Chaparral Trailer Park in Pangburn, Ark. It should be noted that the term barbecue, in this context, refers to anything edible that has come into contact with a heat source in the out-of-doors. The results are rarely pretty but make for the kind of entertaining reading often associated with milk coming out of one's nose. The necessity for a third volume of such d\u201atritus-blanc delicacies (Ruby Anne's Down Home Trailer Park Cookbook started the wheels rolling) was brought about not by the public's overwhelming demand but rather, as the author suggests, by a scarcity of government-surplus cheese, which was a staple of so many of her previous creations: budget-conscious chefs will have to dole out for Velveeta this time around to fill their Armadillo Eggs (a.k.a. stuffed jalapenos). Other frights from the cupboard show up in Billy Bob's Kabobs, a skewer full of Spam and bell peppers. Yes, one could try their hand at El Wienie Mexicano, which takes taco seasoning to a place it best ought not to go, but the better bet is to hit the Taco Bell drive-thru and then settle in with the trailer park updates and cooking tips that bookend the Pork Entombed Trout and the Born-Again Baked Beans. It is here that one discovers how to cook in a lightning storm (\"send someone else out to flip the burgers\") and that 57-year-old Donna Sue, over in Lot #6, is still headlining at the Blue Whale Strip Club. <br /><br />Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."

        "abstract": "Acclaimed by many as the world's greatest novel, <i>Anna Karenina</i> provides a vast panorama of contemporary life in Russia and of humanity in general. In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.<br /><br />Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch. As Rosemary Edmonds comments, 'He leaves the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope to bring home the meaning of the brooding words following the title, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay."

        "abstract": "One of the most dazzling and adventurous writers now working in English takes on the enigma of the Cambridge spies in a novel of exquisite menace, biting social comedy, and vertiginous moral complexity. The narrator is the elderly Victor Maskell, formerly of British intelligence, for many years art expert to the Queen. Now he has been unmasked as a Russian agent and subjected to a disgrace that is almost a kind of death. But at whose instigation?<br /><br />As Maskell retraces his tortuous path from his recruitment at Cambridge to the airless upper regions of the establishment, we discover a figure of manifold doubleness: Irishman and Englishman; husband, father, and lover of men; betrayer and dupe. Beautifully written, filled with convincing fictional portraits of Maskell's co-conspirators, and vibrant with the mysteries of loyalty and identity, <i>The Untouchable</i> places John Banville in the select company of both Conrad and le Carre.<br /><br />Winner of the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction<br /><br />\"Contemporary fiction gets no better than this... Banville's books teem with life and humor.\" - Patrick McGrath, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br />\"Victor Maskell is one of the great characters in recent fiction... <i>The Untouchable</i> is the best work of art in any medium on [its] subject.\" -<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br />\"As remarkable a literary voice as any to come out of Ireland; Joyce and Beckett notwithstanding.\" -<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>"

        "abstract": "Every sixth human being in the world today is an Indian, and every sixth Indian is an untouchable. For thousands of years the untouchables, or Dalits, the people at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, have been treated as subhuman. Their story has rarely been told. This remarkable book achieves something altogether unprecedented: it gives voice to India's voiceless. <br /> In <i>Untouchables,</i> Narendra Jadhav tells the awe-inspiring story of his family's struggle for equality and justice in India. While most Dalits had accepted their lowly position as fate, Jadhav's father rebelled against the oppressive caste system and fought against all odds to forge for his children a destiny that was never ordained. <br /> Based on his father's diaries and family stories, Jadhav has written the triumphant story of his parents -- their great love, unwavering courage, and eventual victory in the struggle to free themselves and their children from the caste system. Jadhav vividly brings his parents' world to light and unflinchingly documents the life of untouchables -- the hunger, the cruel humiliations, the perpetual fear and brutal abuse. <br /> Compelling and deeply compassionate, <i>Untouchables</i> is a son's tribute to his parents, an illuminating chronicle of one of the most important moments in Indian history, and an eye-opening work of nonfiction that gives readers access and insight into the lives of India's 165 million Dalits, whose struggle for equality continues even today."

The book promises to make a major contribution to the social and economic debates on poverty, while its wide-ranging perspectives will ensure a readership from across the disciplines."

        "abstract": "There is much in Vasant Moon's story of his vasti, his childhood neighborhood in India, that would probably be true of any ghetto anywhere in the world. There is hunger and deprivation, to be sure, but also a sense of community, an easy acceptance of petty crime and violence, the saving grace of sports and organized activities led by caring adults, the off-again on-again aid from relatives, the inexplicable cruelty and unexpected generosity, and escape through education. But there is much here that is peculiarly and vividly Indian as well. Primary among these is the factor of caste, a hierarchical system unrelated to race but based on ancient principles of hereditary pollution and purity, with Brahmans the purest and Untouchables the most polluted. Second is the presence of a hero so important he is described as a \"wave,\" and surely no despised group has ever had a leader as meaningful as Dr. B. R. (Babasaheb) Ambedkar was and remains for India's awakened and ambitious Dalits. Third is nature, with Moon's compelling descriptions of Nagpur's heat and the vivid joy brought by the monsoon. Indeed, every tree, every fruit, every nook and cranny of the world in and around the vasti plays an important part in his story. Dalit literature, poetry, plays, and autobiographies have been one of the most important developments in the culture of India in the past thirty years, yet little has been translated for a Western audience. Vasant Moon's Growing Up Untouchable, the first Dalit autobiography to be published in English, is a moving and eloquent testament to a uniquely Indian life as well as to the universal human spirit."

        "abstract": "What is required for something to be evidence for a hypothesis? <br /><br />In this fascinating, elegantly written work, distinguished philosopher of science Peter Achinstein explores this question, rejecting typical philosophical and statistical theories of evidence. He claims these theories are much too weak to give scientists what they want--a good reason to believe--and, in some cases, they furnish concepts that mistakenly make all evidential claims a priori. <br /><br />Achinstein introduces four concepts of evidence, defines three of them by reference to \"potential\" evidence, and characterizes the latter using a novel epistemic interpretation of probability. The resulting theory is then applied to philosophical and historical issues. Solutions are provided to the \"grue,\" \"ravens,\" \"lottery,\" and \"old-evidence\" paradoxes, and to a series of questions. These include whether explanations or predictions furnish more evidential weight, whether individual hypotheses or entire theoretical systems can receive evidential support, what counts as a scientific discovery, and what sort of evidence is required for it. The historical questions include whether Jean Perrin had non-circular evidence for the existence of molecules, what type of evidence J.J. Thomson offered for the existence of the electron, and whether, as is usually supposed, he really discovered the electron. Achinstein proposes answers in terms of the concepts of evidence introduced. <br /><br />As the premier book in the fabulous new series Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Science, this volume is essential for philosophers of science and historians of science, as well as for statisticians, scientists with philosophical interests, and anyone curious about scientific reasoning."

        "abstract": "In April 1992, a discovery was made that changed the way we view the world. Dr. George Smoot, distinguished cosmologist and adventurer, whose quest for cosmic knowledge had taken him from the Brazilian rain forest to the South Pole unveiled his momentous discovery, bringing to light the very nature of the universe. For anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered, for anyone who has ever longed to pull aside the fabric of the universe for a glimpse of what lies behind it. <i>Wrinkles in Time</i> is the story of Smoot's search to uncover the cosmic seeds of the universe. <i>Wrinkles in Time</i> is the Double Helix of cosmology, an intimate look at the inner world of men and women who ask. \"Why are we here?\" It tells the story of George Smoot's dogged pursuit of the cosmic wrinkles in the frozen wastes of Antarctica, on mountaintops, in experiments borne aloft aboard high-altitude balloons, U-2 spy planes, and finally a space satellite. <i>Wrinkles in Time</i> presents the hard science behind the structured violence of the big bang theory through breathtakingly clear, lucid images and meaningful comparisons. Scientists and nonscientists alike can follow with rapt attention the story of how, in a fiery creation, wrinkles formed in space ultimately to become stars, galaxies, and even greater delicate structures. Anyone can appreciate the implications of a universe whose end is written in its beginnings - whose course developed according to a kind of cosmic DNA, which guided the universe from simplicity and symmetry to ever-greater complexity and structure. As controversial as it may seem today, <i>Wrinkles in Time</i> reveals truths that, in an earlier century, would have doomed its proclaimers to the fiery stake. For four thousand years some people have accepted the Genesis account of cosmic origin; for most of this century, scientists debated two rival scientific explanations known as the steady state and big bang theories. And now, <i>Wrinkles in Time</i> tells what really happened.<br /><br />The personal story behind astrophysicist George Smoot's incredible discovery of the origin of the cosmos, hailed by Stephen Hawking as \"The scientific discovery of the century, if not of all time.\""

People are also saying that their father has run off and left their brilliant scientist mother. Spurred on by these rumors, Meg and Charles Wallace, along with their new friend Calvin, embark on a perilous quest through space to find their father. In doing so they must travel behind the shadow of an evil power that is darkening the cosmos, one planet at a time.</p><p><br />Young people who have trouble finding their place in the world will connect with the \"misfit\" characters in this provocative story. This is no superhero tale, nor is it science fiction, although it shares elements of both. The travelers must rely on their individual and collective strengths, delving deep into their characters to find answers.</p><p><br />A classic since 1962, Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> is sophisticated in concept yet warm in tone, with mystery and love coursing through its pages. Meg's shattering yet ultimately freeing discovery that her father is not omnipotent provides a satisfying coming-of-age element. Readers will feel a sense of power as they travel with these three children, challenging concepts of time, space, and the power of good over evil. <i> (Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><p>\n  <br /></p> <br />One stormy night a strange visitor comes to the Murry house and beckons Meg, her brother, Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin O'Keefe on a most dangerous and fantastic journey\u2014a journey that will threaten their lives and our universe.<p><br /><br />Meg Murray, her little brother Charles Wallace, and their mother are having a midnight snack on a dark and stormy night when an unearthly stranger appears at their door. He claims to have been blown off course, and goes on to tell them that there is such a thing as a \"tesseract,\" which, if you didn't know, is a wrinkle in time.</p><p><br /><br />Meg's father had been experimenting with time-travel when he suddenly disappeared. Will Meg, Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin outwit the forces of evil as they search through space for their father?</p>"

Splendid futures seem to be promised for her children; but the religious rift opened by Henry VIII has never been fully healed, and conflict resurfaces at the accession of the Catholic James II. Frightening times ensue, when it is impossible to know who to trust. Annunciata herself is put on trial, while jealousy, betrayal and sudden death threaten her family. And in the shadow of revolution comes a new love to Annunciata, one that can only lead to tragedy."

D. James and Ruth Rendell, Charles Todd writes novels that transcend genre.\" <em>A Long Shadow </em>proves that statement true beyond the shadow of a doubt. Once again featuring Todd's extraordinary protagonist, Scotland Yard investigator and shell-shocked World War One veteran, Inspector Ian Rutledge, <em>A Long Shadow</em> immerses readers in the sights and sounds of post-war Great Britain, as the damaged policeman pursues answers to a constable's slaying and the three-year-old mystery of a young girl's disappearance in a tiny Northamptonshire village. Read Todd's <em>A Long Shadow </em>and see why the <em>Washington Post</em> calls the Rutledge crime novels, \"one of the best historical series being written today.\"<br />"

        "abstract": "During the hottest days of the summer of 1863, while the nation's attention was focused on a small town in Pennsylvania known as Gettysburg, another momentous battle was being fought along the banks of the Mississippi. In the longest single campaign of the war, the siege of Vicksburg left 19,000 dead and wounded on both sides, gave the Union Army control of the Mississippi, and left the Confederacy cut in half. In this highly-anticipated new work, Christopher Waldrep takes a fresh look at how the Vicksburg campaign was fought and remembered. He begins with a gripping account of the battle, deftly recounting the experiences of African-American troops fighting for the Union. Waldrep shows how as the scars of battle faded, the memory of the war was shaped both by the Northerners who controlled the battlefield and by the legacies of race and slavery that played out over the decades that followed."

        "abstract": "It started as a daydream. Poring over a map of the world at home one quiet Saturday afternoon, Ewan McGregor -- acclaimed actor and self-confessed bike nut -- noticed that it was possible to ride all the way round the world, with just one short hop across the Bering Strait from Russia to Alaska. It was a revelation he couldn't get out of his head. So he picked up the phone and called his fellow actor-slash-biker friend Charley Boorman and told him it was time to hit the road.... <br /> Long Way Round <br /> Beginning in London, Ewan and Charley chased their shadows through Europe, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia; across the Pacific to Alaska; then down through Canada all the way to New York. <i>Long Way Round</i> is the result of their four-month, 20,000-mile joyride. Featuring original diary entries, travel maps, mileage charts, and dozens of photographs, this is a freewheeling, fully charged, and uproariously entertaining book about two world-famous individuals who chose the road not taken...and made the journey worthwhile."

        "abstract": "The city-state of Saraykeht dominates the Summer Cities. Its wealth is beyond measure; its port is open to all the merchants of the world, and its ruler, the Khai Saraykeht, commands forces to rival the Gods. Commerce and trade fill the streets with a hundred languages, and the coffers of the wealthy with jewels and gold. Any desire, however exotic or base, can be satisfied in its soft quarter. Blissfully ignorant of the forces that fuel their prosperity, the people live and work secure in the knowledge that their city is a bastion of progress in a harsh world. It would be a tragedy if it fell.<br /><br />Saraykeht is poised on the knife-edge of disaster.<br /><br />At the heart of the city's influence are the poet-sorcerer Heshai and the captive spirit, Seedless, whom he controls. For all his power, Heshai is weak, haunted by memories of shame and humiliation. A man faced with constant reminders of his responsibilities and his failures, he is the linchpin and the most vulnerable point in Saraykeht's greatness.<br /><br />Far to the west, the armies of Galt have conquered many lands. To take Saraykeht, they must first destroy the trade upon which its prosperity is based. Marchat Wilsin, head of Galt's trading house in the city, is planning a terrible crime against Heshai and Seedless. If he succeeds, Saraykeht will fall.<br /><br />Amat, House Wilsin's business manager, is a woman who rose from the slums to wield the power that Marchat Wilsin would use to destroy her city. Through accidents of fate and circumstance Amat, her apprentice Liat, and two young men from the farthest reaches of their society stand alone against the dangers that threaten the city."

Tired of struggling against alimony payments, two teenage daughters, a very pregnant, very single partner, and a low paying job as a Miami homicide detective, Hoke moves to Singer Island and vows never step foot on the mainland again. But on the street, career criminal Troy Louden is hatching plans of his own with a gang including a disfigured hooker, a talentless artist, and a clueless retiree. But when his simple robbery results in ruthless and indiscriminate bloodshed, Hoke quickly remembers why he is a cop and hurls himself back into the world he meant to leave behind forever.<br /><br />A masterly tale of both mid-life crisis and murder, <b>Sideswipe</b> is a page-turning thriller packed with laughs, loaded with suspense, and featuring one of the truly original detectives of all time."

He has too much going on at home, especially with a man he helped convict ten years before moving in across the street. Hoke immediately assumes the worst, and considering he has his former partner, who happens to be nursing a newborn, and his two teenage daughters living with him, he doesn't like the situation on bit. It doesn't help matters when he is suddenly assigned to work undercover, miles away, outside of his jurisdiction and without his badge, his gun, or his teeth. Soon, he is impersonating a drifter and tring to infiltrate a farm operation suspected of murdering migrant workers. But when he gets there for his job interview, the last thing he is offered is work.<br /><br />In this final installment of the highly acclaimed Hoke Moseley novels, Charles Willeford's brilliance and expertise show on every page. Equally funny, thrilling, and disturbing, The Way We Die Now is a triumphant finish to one of the most original detective series of all time."

        "abstract": "After a brutal day investigating a quadruple homicide, Detective Hoke Moseley settles into his room at the un-illustrious El Dorado Hotel and nurses a glass of brandy. With his guard down, he doesn\u2019t think twice when he hears a knock on the door. The next day, he finds himself in the hospital, badly bruised and with his jaw wired shut. He thinks back over ten years of cases wondering who would want to beat him into unconsciousness, steal his gun and badge, and most importantly, make off with his prized dentures. But the pieces never quite add up to revenge, and the few clues he has keep connecting to a dimwitted hooker, and her ex-con boyfriend and the bizarre murder of a Hare Krishna pimp.<br /><br />Chronically depressed, constantly strapped for money, always willing to bend the rules a bit, Hoke Moseley is hardly what you think of as the perfect cop, but he is one of the the greatest detective creations of all time."

Eddie Miller is an airline pilot who's studying to get his real estate license. Don Luchessi is a silver salesman who's separated from his wife but too Catholic to get a divorce. Hank Norton is a drug company rep who gets four times as many dames as any of the other guys. They are all regular guys who like to drink, play cards, meet broads, and shoot a little pool. But when a friendly bet goes horribly awry, they find themselves with two dead bodies on their hands and a homicidal husband in the wings\u2014and acting more like hardened criminals than upstanding citizens."

        "abstract": "\"No one writes a better crime novel than Charles Willeford\" Elmore Leonard THE BLACK MASS OF BROTHER SPRINGER tells the story of Sam Springer, a drifter novelist who meets Jack Dover, the retiring Abbot of the Church of God's Flock. Dover's final official act is to ordain Springer and send him off to serve as pastor of an all-Black church in Jacksonville, Florida. Springer soon becomes entangled in the city's growing civil rights movement . . . and with the church deacon's earthy young wife, Merita. The Washington post calls this darkly humorous novel by Charles Willeford, one of the great crime writers of the 20th century, \"his masterpiece.\" This new edition is introduced by James Sallis and contains Willeford's previously unpublished play based on the novel."

        "abstract": "Is comedy postmodern?Kirby Olson posits that no one has been more marginalized than the comic writer, whose irreverent truths have always made others uncomfortable. In a literary age that purports to champion diversity, comic writers remain an underclass huddling at the fringes of the canon. Olson challenges the status quo by inviting the comic writer into the center of literary debate.In the growing discipline of humor studies, Olson is the first to create a substantial link between the fields of comedy and postmodernism, discovering in comic writers a philosophy of oddness and paradox that parallels and extends the work of the major postmodern thinkers.With elegant clarity, Comedy After Post-modernism examines: Edward Lear as he invents a comic picturesque to challenge the sublime of Kant and Ruskin Gregory Corso as he explodes the Great Chain of Being of his early Catholicism Philippe Soupault as a comic surrealist undoing the sacrificial aesthetics of Andr\u00e9 Breton P.G. Wodehouse as a social thinker with surprisingly deep affinities to anarchist Peter Kropotkin and radical social theorist Charles Fourier Stewart Home, the infamously violent punk author, as a pacifist whose narrative questions Marxist-anarchist terrorism in favor of patience and tolerance Charles Willeford, the maestro of the black humor police procedural, as a postmodern philosopher who deepens the problems of ethical and aesthetic judgment after postmodernism. \u201cAn original, splendidly researched, and necessary book. By pointing to the vast excluded literature of \u2018comic writers,\u2019 Dr. Olson opens the door to a postmodern scholarship capable of greater flexibility. Comedy After Postmodernism evinces a lucid, passionate, and engaging style.\u201d \u2014Andrei Codrescu There was an old man on the Border, Who lived in the utmost disorder;He danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat,Which vexed all the folks on the Border.\u2014From The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear"

        "abstract": "Florida homicide detective Hoke Moseley's life suddenly went to bell one morning. His ex-wife had married a big-time pro ballplayer. His two teenage daughters moved in. And his lieutenant had dumped ever? unsolved murder in Miami on him. So Hoke decided to bail out stretch out on Singer Island, give up police work, and watch the ocean roll.<br /><br />But trouble wasn't going to let Hoke get away. Not a stone's throw from his laid-back new life, a slick, handsome psychopath was planning his next armed robbery. The heist would suck a curmudgeon retiree into a life of crime, blast a half-dozen people, off the planet, and leave nary a clue behind.<br /><br />It was a case right up Hoke's alley: weird enough to catch his attention, personal enough to make him mad, and twisted enough to make Hoke forget he didn't want to be a cop...a good guy in a world gone very, very bad."

        "abstract": "Tom Wolfe, the master social novelist of our time, the spot-on chronicler of all things contemporary and cultural, presents a sensational new novel about life, love, and learning--or the lack of it--amid today's American colleges.<br /><br />Our story unfolds at fictional Dupont University: those Olympian halls of scholarship housing the cream of America's youth, the roseate Gothic spires and manicured lawns suffused with tradition . . . Or so it appears to beautiful, brilliant Charlotte Simmons, a sheltered freshman from North Carolina. But Charlotte soon learns, to her mounting dismay, that for the upper-crust coeds of Dupont, sex, cool, and kegs trump academic achievement every time.<br /><br />As Charlotte encounters the paragons of Dupont's privileged elite--her roommate, Beverly, a Groton-educated Brahmin in lusty pursuit of lacrosse players; Jojo Johanssen, the only white starting player on Dupont's godlike basketball team, whose position is threatened by a hotshot black freshman from the projects; the Young Turk of Saint Ray fraternity, Hoyt Thorpe, whose heady sense of entitlement and social domination is clinched by his accidental brawl with a bodyguard for the governor of California; and Adam Geller, one of the Millennial Mutants who run the university's \"independent\" newspaper and who consider themselves the last bastion of intellectual endeavor on the sex-crazed, jock-obsessed campus--she is seduced by the heady glamour of acceptance, betraying both her values and upbringing before she grasps the power of being different--and the exotic allure of her own innocence.<br /><br />With his trademark satirical wit and famously sharp eye for telling detail, Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons draws on extensive observations at campuses across the country to immortalize the early-21st-century college-going experience."

This delightful collection, the most comprehensive ever compiled of his work, presents all of Lear's verse and other nonsense writings, including stories, letters, and illustrated alphabets, as well as previously unpublished material. Featuring Lear's own line drawings throughout and an introduction by leading Lear authority Vivien Noakes, this captivating volume reveals a complex man of ample talents, achievements, and influence-and is teeming with timeless nonsense."

Filled with exuberantly nonsensical made-up words (like \"Scroobius Pip\" and \"pobble\"!) that tickle the funny bone, his work gives free rein to youthful imaginations. What better to foster a love of poetry than the immediately appealing The Owl and the Pussy-Cat, with its effortless rhymes, songlike beat, and charming animal characters? Or The Quangle Wangle's Hat, which tells the tale of a creature who warmly welcomes everyone--and so makes everyone cheerful. In Dingle Bank, even some young and mischievous boys punished by their schoolmaster make the best of their situation and succeed in having a good time. Bright and fanciful paintings--all as wildly energetic and unrestrained as the language itself--add to the enjoyment. 20 examples of Lear's finest poems will entice children over and over again--and, as always, this acclaimed series features fascinating biographical information, introductions to each verse, and full annotations that define difficult vocabulary.<br />"

She traveled to the Caribbean (the land where the Bong-tree grows, perhaps?) to research her illustrations as well as the settings, costume details, plants, and fish native to the area. Readers can follow an illustrated subplot of two yellow fish who also fall in love under the pea-green boat. A charming treatment of a classic children's poem. <i>(Ages 3 to 7)</i>"

In this brilliant book he has selected and illustrated his favourite comic verse, making it pure entertainment for nonsense-lovers of all ages. His unique style of drawing brings a new perspective to every poem. Classic writers such as Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear are combined with more contemporary talents such as Roger McGough, Margaret Mahy and Russell Hoban. With fifteen wonderfully absurd sections, including Distracting Creatures, Sticky Ends, I Wish I Were a Jelly Fish, A Recipe for Indigestion and Chortling and Galumphing, here is a delightful collection of the topsy-turvy, the fantastical, the anarchic, the illogical and the utterly wonderful."

        "abstract": "The Colossus of Maroussi is an impressionist travelogue by Henry Miller, written in 1939 and first published in 1941 by Colt Press of San Francisco. As an impoverished writer in need of rejuvenation, Miller travelled to Greece at the invitation of his friend, the writer Lawrence Durrell. The text is inspired by the events that occurred. The text is ostensibly a portrait of the Greek writer George Katsimbalis, although some critics have opined that is more of a self-portrait of Miller himself.[1] Miller considered it to be his greatest work."

Whether discussing the early days of his long friendship with Alfred Perles or his escapades at the Club Melody brothel, in Quiet Days in Clichy Miller describes a period that would shape his entire life and oeuvre."

He has a fine touch for comedy. But this is also a serious book the testament of a free spirit who has broken through the restraints and cliches of modern life to find within himself his own kind of paradise.<br /><br />"

Only a historic court ruling that changed American censorship standards, ushering in a new era of freedom and frankness in modern literature, permitted the publication of this first volume of Miller\u2019s famed mixture of memoir and fiction, which chronicles with unapologetic gusto the bawdy adventures of a young expatriate writer, his friends, and the characters they meet in Paris in the 1930s. <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> is now considered, as Norman Mailer said, \"one of the ten or twenty great novels of our century.\""

Colin MacInne Praise for 'Sexus': 'A huge, sprawling narrative of Miller's life in New York, \"Sexus'\"culminates in a description of an orgy as remarkable for its account of the author's powers of sexual endurance as for its versatility. Interspersed are descriptions of his friends, some of them extremely funny and all of them lively. The lack of inhibition and genteel or moral restraint with which Miller describes these various characters gives \"Sexus\" a unique vitality. Miller cannot be pompous, a rare virtue, and his honesty is absolute.' Spectator"

In her exceptional memoir, Phillips reveals in thoughtful detail their tumultuous life together. She describes the mad and impulsive times with the infamous hellraiser alongside the tempestuous, insecure, and often lonely periods in their marriage. When OToole's career took off with \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" Sian found life increasingly difficult in her parallel roles as wife, mother, and actress, and watched as her own career became progressively sidelined. Against all expectations, though, their union endured for twenty years. When it ended, incredibly, even to herself, Sian plunged straight into another marriage, to a much younger man. Ultimately she emerges alone--triumphant and unrepentant--and the story she recounts here ranks alongside the very best in show business.<br />"

While most studies of social interaction have gone behind closed doors to focus on relationships in the family, school, and workplace, this innovative collection pushes the boundaries of the field by analyzing both fleeting and anchored relationships in the seldom-studied communal areas where much of contemporary life takes place. The contributors shed light on the diversity and character of day-to-day negotiations in public spaces and at the same time illuminate how these social ties paradoxically blend aspects of durability and brevity, of emotional closeness and distance, of being together and alone."

Squares is intended to help designers, planners, public officials, students, developers, and community leaders understand the history and theories of public commons, elicit community dialogue and desires, respond to the natural and built environment, and design compelling places.<br /><br />Mark C. Childs contends that places built to support conviviality are critical components of a good town. He includes theory, brief case studies, and 126 design queries and discussions. These questions range from the general--\"How can the life of the community be strengthened by the planning of a civic place?\"--to the particular--\"Is the place delightful on a Tuesday morning?\" \"What makes a good place for a rendezvous?\" Childs explores the design implications of the automobile, electronic media, the natural environment, urban furniture and structures, public safety, and public art. Interspersed with Childs's text are brief essays by other authors addressing particular kinds of public spaces: parks, urban beaches, farmers' markets, and community gardens."

        "abstract": "The Just In Time! series offers brief, practical resources of immediate help for pastors at an affordable price.<br /><br />Part of a pastor's role in the community is to pray publicly. The pastor is often the official \"pray-er\" at all kinds of community events--the high school football game, the opening of the new grocery store, the county school board meeting, kindergarten graduation--to name a few. But the pastor must also pray knowing that there are believers (of many persuasions) and non-believers present. In addition to the prayers in this book, there are brief setting descriptions and Scripture references. These prayers can be used with little or no adaptation.<br /><br />Sample prayers: Graduation: \"O God, Author of all wisdom, Giver of all truth, Seeker of all servants, we thank You for the times of life that mark Your continuing goodness. We are grateful for these believers, young in their faith and early in their journey, who have been open to study and learning and who now gain graduation toward tomorrows which will take them in many direction, but never from Your presence.\"<br /><br />Suicide: \"O God, if we knew why, we would name it before You! Hear our plea for help; hear our plea for hope. We confess that we do not grasp the depths which drive one of Your children to end the life You began. We confess that faint stirrings of guilt, soft wondering about our own inattentions, and a simple unease all groan within us. Grant us a grace which will be sufficient for our own broken and breaking places.\"<br /><br />Citizenship: \"O God, The Giver of beginnings, we praise You for giving to Your servants fresh possibilities, extended hopes, and a new nation. You have given them life and now You give them calls to new loyalties, new responsibilities, and new opportunities. We make no claim for the perfection of this nations, but we do make full claim upon Your presence in its work for justice, its care for the poor, and its openness to those who seek to be its people.\""

This book, written in a lyrical style with wit and passion, intends to redeem melancholy and restore it to its rightful place in the human psyche, as a Muse of creative force, a characteristic of greatness, and a bittersweet comfort in the sensitive soul."

To question six decades of story telling, all the essays together operate as a deceitful, yet indispensable confession."

        "abstract": "One of France's greatest novelists offers a remarkable diary of the Nazi occupation of Paris during World War II and of its eventual liberation by the Allies. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the liberation, this extraordinary diary by the author of The Lover is \"a haunting portrait of a time and place\" (New York Times).<br /><br />Written in 1944, and first published in 1985, Duras's riveting account of life in Paris during the Nazi occupation and the first months of liberation depicts the harrowing realities of World War II-era France \"with a rich conviction enhanced by [a] spare, almost arid, technique\" (Julian Barnes, The Washington Post Book World). Duras, by then married and part of a French resistance network headed by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand, tells of nursing her starving husband back to health after his return from Bergen-Belsen, interrogating a suspected collaborator, and playing a game of cat and mouse with a Gestapo officer who was attracted to her. The result is \"more than one woman's diary...[it is] a haunting portrait of a time and a place and also a state of mind\" (The New York Times)."

        "abstract": "In this classic novel by the best-selling author of The Lover, erotic intrigue masks a chillingly deceptive form of madness. Elisabeth Alione is convalescing in a hotel in rural France when she meets two men and another woman. The sophisticated dalliance among the four serves to obscure an underlying violence, which, when the curtain of civilization is drawn aside, reveals in her fellow guests a very contemporary, perhaps even new, form of insanity. Like many of Duras's novels, Destroy, She Said owes much to cinema, displaying a skillful interplay of dialogue and description. There are recurring moods and motifs from the Duras repertoire: eroticism, lassitude, stifled desire, a beautiful woman, a mysterious forest, a desolate provincial hotel. Included in this volume is an in-depth interview with Duras by Jacques Rivette and Jean Narboni."

        "abstract": "Kahlil Gibran, author of \"The Prophet,\" is known throughout the world as The Immortal Prophet of Lebanon and the Savant of his Age. The very heart of the mystic East emerges in this monumental volume of the magnificent poetry and prose that he wrote in his beloved mother tongue, Arabic. Translated superbly into English, here are the nine great books, gathered together in one giant volume and now available in a paperback edition for Gibran's myriad admirers in America.<br /><br />In these writings \"the Dante of the twentieth century\" offers verses and lyric prose which possess all the grandeur of rich music. Here are the great truths and heartening joys, drawn from the tears and sufferings of man. Here are pages that sparkle with simile and symbolism, of which Gibran is the world's unquestioned master.<br /><br />And here is the profound exaltation of a great soul that has found salvation in the heart of sorrow. In this book you will find wistful beauty, fierce anger, spellbinding majesty, and the abiding peace that Eastern wisdom seeks eternally in contemplation.<br /><br />The nine books which make up \"A Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\" contain the texts of \"Secrets of the Heart,\" \"Tears and Laughter\" and \"Spirits Rebellious,\" together with hitherto unpublished writings by Gibran, which are included in the brilliant preface by the distinguished Gibran scholar, Martin L. Wolf."

Published in 1923, it has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American editions alone have sold more than nine million copies.<br /><i><br />The Prophet </i>is a collection of poetic essays that are philosophical, spiritual, and, above all, inspirational. Gibran\u2019s musings are divided into twenty-eight chapters covering such sprawling topics as love, marriage, children, giving, eating and drinking, work, joy and sorrow, housing, clothes, buying and selling, crime and punishment, laws, freedom, reason and passion, pain, self-knowledge, teaching, friendship, talking, time, good and evil, prayer, pleasure, beauty, religion, and death.<br /><br />Each essay reveals deep insights into the impulses of the human heart and mind. The <i>Chicago Post </i>said of <i>The Prophet</i>: \u201cCadenced and vibrant with feeling, the words of Kahlil Gibran bring to one\u2019s ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes . . . If there is a man or woman who can read this book without a quiet acceptance of a great man\u2019s philosophy and a singing in the heart as of music born within, that man or woman is indeed dead to life and truth.\u201d<br /><br />With twelve full-page drawings by Gibran, this beautiful work makes an incredible gift for anyone seeking enlightenment and inspiration."

Gibran allows the reader to see Jesus through the eyes of a group of people, enemies and friends alike. Each has an opinion about Jesus based on their own experience. Khalil Gibran was a Lebanese-American artist, poet, and writer. As a young man he emigrated with his family to the United States where he studied art and began his literary career. His Romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature he is still celebrated as a literary hero."

        "abstract": "This is the exquisitely tender story of love that beats desperately against the taboos of Oriental tradition. With great sensitivity, Gibran describes his passion as a youth for Selma Karamy, the girl of Beirut who first unfolded to him the secrets of love. But it is a love that is doomed by a social convention which forces Selma into marriage with another man. Portraying the happiness and infinite sorrow of his relationship with Selma, Gibran at the same time probes the spiritual meaning of human existence with profound compassion. **Lightning Print On Demand Title"

        "abstract": "\"For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, <i>Treasure Island</i> has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the nevel creates scenes and characters that have firetd the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, <i>Treasure Island</i> is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like <i>Treasure Island</i> that can keep boys and old men happy.'"

        "abstract": "George Eliot\u2019s final novel and her most ambitious work, <b>Daniel Deronda</b> contrasts the moral laxity of the British aristocracy with the dedicated fervor of Jewish nationalists. Crushed by a loveless marriage to the cruel and arrogant Grandcourt, Gwendolen Harleth seeks salvation in the deeply spiritual and altruistic Daniel Deronda. But Deronda, profoundly affected by the discovery of his Jewish ancestry, is ultimately too committed to his own cultural awakening to save Gwendolen from despair. <br /><br />This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the 1878 Cabinet Edition."

In the 100 years since the Wright brothers' first powered flight, aviation has witnessed many memorable events. From record-breaking flights and aerial warfare, to advances in aircraft design and the race for space, Flight covers the most memorable moments in the history of aviation. Describing the feats of the brave men and women who piloted the early flying machines, to the pioneers of long-distance flight and the test pilots who ushered in the jet age, Flight is a gripping narrative of humankind's quest to conquer the skies and explore space. Loaded with spectacular full-color photographs, dramatic first-hand accounts, and fact-filled profiles on a huge range of aircraft, this is an enthralling account of a century of innovation and adventure."

En los tres primeros cap\u00edtulos se narra el \u00e9xodo de un grupo de familias y el establecimiento del pueblo de Macondo, desde el cap\u00edtulo 4 hasta el 16 se trata el desarrollo econ\u00f3mico, pol\u00edtico y social del pueblo y los \u00faltimos cuatro cap\u00edtulos narran su decadencia."

        "abstract": "<b>Renowned primatologist Robert Sapolsky offers a completely revised and updated edition of his most popular work, with nearly 90,000 copies in print</b><br /><br />\t Now in a third edition, Robert M. Sapolsky's acclaimed and successful <i>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</i> features new chapters on how stress affects sleep and addiction, as well as new insights into anxiety and personality disorder and the impact of spirituality on managing stress.<br />\tAs Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear-and the ones that plague us now-are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way-through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. <br />\tCombining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humor and practical advice, <i>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</i> explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more. It also provides essential guidance to controlling our stress responses. This new edition promises to be the most comprehensive and engaging one yet."

        "abstract": "Jonathan Rowson, author of the highly acclaimed Seven Deadly Chess Sins, investigates three questions important to all chess-players:<br />1) Why is it so difficult, especially for adult players, to improve?<br />2) What kinds of mental attitudes are needed to find good moves in different phases of the game?<br />3) Is White's alleged first-move advantage a myth, and does it make a difference whether you are playing Black or White?<br />In a strikingly original work, Rowson makes use of his academic background in philosophy and psychology to answer these questions in an entertaining and instructive way. This book assists all players in their efforts to improve, and provides fresh insights into the opening and early middlegame.<br /><br />Rowson presents many new ideas on how Black should best combat White's early initiative, and make use of the extra information that he gains as a result of moving second. For instance, he shows that in some cases a situation he calls 'Zugzwang Lite' can arise, where White finds himself lacking any constructive moves. He also takes a close look at the theories of two players who, in differing styles, have specialized in championing Black's cause: Mihai Suba and Andras Adorjan. Readers are also equipped with a 'mental toolkit' that will enable them to handle many typical over-the-board situations with greater success, and avoid a variety of psychological pitfalls.<br /><br /><i>Chess for Zebras</i> offers fresh insights into human idiosyncrasies in all phases of the game. The depth and breadth of this book will therefore help players to appreciate chess at a more profound level, and make steps towards sustained and significant improvement.<br /><br /><br />"

This rhyming picture book introduces twenty new letters and the creatures that one can spell with them. Discover (and spell) such wonderfully Seussian creations as the Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz and the High Gargel-orum. Readers young and old will be giggling from beginning to end . . . or should we say, from Yuzz to Hi!"

If one or the other fails to appear, then the present party receives the entire fortune. Molly has no intention to wed Hart, but if she inherits the money she could help her brother regain his proper place in Society. Besides, she's convinced that her prospective groom, who has always accused her of being a fortune hunter, will not present himself. As Molly embarks on a daring charade, she discovers a fierce opponent in Hart -and an even fiercer desire for this dangerously handsome man who may prove impossible to resist...</p>"

Since ten-year-old Adine already has four younger sisters, she is used to the routine. This time, however, the routine is broken -- in more ways than one. The biggest change is that Aunt Irene will be staying with the Vorlobs until Adine's mother is back on her feet. Aunt Irene arrives, as does the baby, but nothing else goes quite as expected.

That\u2019s why <i>A</i> is for <i>zebrA </i>and <i>Z</i> is for <i>jazZ</i>, and nothing\u2019s what you\u2019d expect. The featured letter doesn\u2019t appear just once\u2014it\u2019s sprinkled throughout the hilarious illustrations. The <i>I</i> page not only has <i>sushI</i>, there\u2019s <i>delI</i>, <i>spaghettI</i>, <i>graffitI</i>, and <i>khakI</i>, too. And if you think working backwards makes it easier, well, just try to come up with words that end in Q or J! The results can be quite surprising!<br /><br />Teachers, librarians, parents, and kids will love the silly\u2014but smart\u2014acrobatics involved in unearthing all these words, along with the witty way the book reinforces the sounds of letters and teaches kids how much fun playing with language can be."

Here are smart, savvy tales of space adventure, time travel, weird science, mysterious phenomena, apocalypse and dystopia, tales that reflect the concerns of their day, yet eerily foreshadow our own. There's Successful Operation, a Twilight Zone-ish gem in which a dictator gets his just desserts...Let There Be Light, about two inventors who triumph over political corruption...and On the Slopes of Vesuvius, in which a Bomb-fearing barkeep sees his worst fears realized. -And He Built A Crooked House- tells of an architect whose innovative home design leads straight into a funhouse fourth dimension. Solution Unsatisfactory gives us a chilling alternate end to WWII, while -All You Zombies- paints a time-twisty picture of the ultimate causality paradox. All these and more, including three previously uncollected stories, Beyond Doubt, My Object All Sublime and Pied Piper, display Heinlein's creative genius to full extent."

        "abstract": "Robert A. Heinlein was the most influential science fiction writer of his era, an influence so large that, as Samuel R. Delany notes, \"modern critics attempting to wrestle with that influence find themselves dealing with an object rather like the sky or an ocean.\" He won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, a record that still stands. <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> was the last of these Hugo-winning novels, and it is widely considered his finest work.<br /><br />It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of the former Lunar penal colony against the Lunar Authority that controls it from Earth. It is the tale of the disparate people - a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic - who become the rebel movement's leaders. And it is the story of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to this inner circle, and who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.<br /><br /><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is one of the high points of modern science fiction, a novel bursting with politics, humanity, passion, innovative technical speculation, and a firm belief in the pursuit of human freedom.<br /><br /><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is the winner of the 1967 Hugo Award for Best Novel.<br /><br />"

The cat is Pixel, well-known to fans of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Cat Who Walks through Walls.</i> The man is a stranger to her, and besides that, he is dead . . .<br /><br />So begins Robert A. Heinlein's newest novel, <i>To Sail Beyond the Sunset</i>. Filled with the master's most beloved characters, this compelling work broadens and enriches his epic visions of time and space, life and death, love and desire. It is also an autobiographical masterpiece--and a wondrous return to the alternate universes that all Heinlein fans have come to know and love..."

It has since been in print for 50 years in paperback, and now returns to hardcover for a new generation. <br />Travel to other planets is a reality, and with overpopulation stretching the resources of Earth, the necessity to find habitable worlds is growing ever more urgent. With no time to wait years for communication between slower-than-light spaceships and home, the Long Range Foundation explores an unlikely solution--human telepathy.<br />Identical twins Tom and Pat are enlisted to be the human radios that will keep the ships in contact with Earth. The only problem is that one of them has to stay behind, and that one will grow old while the other explores the depths of space.Always a master of insight into the human consequences of future technologies, this is one of Heinlein's triumphs.<br />"

        "abstract": "Douglas Adams changed the face of science fiction with his cosmically comic novel <i>The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i> and its classic sequels. Sadly for his countless admirers, he hitched his own ride to the great beyond much too soon. Culled posthumously from Adams\u2019s fleet of beloved Macintosh computers, this selection of essays, articles, anecdotes, and stories offers a fascinating and intimate portrait of the multifaceted artist and absurdist wordsmith.<br /><br />Join Adams on an excursion to climb Kilimanjaro\u2026dressed in a rhino costume; peek into the private life of Genghis Khan\u2014warrior and world-class neurotic; root for the harried author\u2019s efforts to get a <i>Hitchhiker</i> movie off the ground in Hollywood; thrill to the further exploits of private eye Dirk Gently and two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox. Though Douglas Adams is gone, he\u2019s left us something very special to remember him by. Without a doubt."

However, instead of being disheartened, Arthur Dent makes the terrible mistake of starting to enjoy life a bit and, immediately, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Hell takes a number of forms: there\u2019s the usual Ford Prefect form of hell, fresh hell in the form of an all-new version of <i>The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i>, and a totally unexpected hell in the form of a teenage girl who startles Arthur Dent by being his daughter when he didn\u2019t even know he had one.<br /><br />Can Arthur save the Earth from total multidimensional obliteration? Can he save the <i>Guide</i> from a hostile alien takeover? Can he save his daughter, Random, from herself? <br /><br />Of course not. He never works out what is going on, exactly. Will you?"

Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.<br /><br />Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book \u201ctrilogy\u201d that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you\u2019ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you\u2019ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic<i>;</i> and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.<br /><br />A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat\u2013while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. <br /><br />By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration\u2013 a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject\u2019s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust. For the countless fans of Douglas Adams and his unique and winsome world, here is a wonderful postcard: to be read, reread, and treasured for the memories it bears.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

        "abstract": "Douglas Adams changed the face of science fiction (to a uniquely and irresistible funny one) with his cosmically comic novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the x, and its classic sequels. Sadly for his countless admirers, he hitched his own ride to the great beyond much too soon. But for anyone who ever laughed out loud at the absurdist adventures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, chuckled knowingly at the daffy definitions in The Meaning of Liff, or experienced the wonders of encountering endangered species in Last Chance to See, here's a wonderful opportunity to revel in the droll wit, off-the-wall humor, and keenly inquiring mind of Douglas Adams just one more time.<br /><br />Culled posthumously from Adams's fleet of beloved Macintosh computers, this selection of essays, articles, anecdotes, and stories offers a fascinating and intimate portrait of the multifaceted artist--as a devout Beatles and Bach fan, radical atheist, enthusiastic technophobe, crusading conservationist, and of course delightful wordsmith.<br /><br />Join him on an excursion to climb Kilimanjaro...dressed in a rhino costume; peek into the private life of Genghis Khan--warrior, conqueror, and world-class neurotic; root for the harried author's efforts to get a Hitchhiker movie off the ground in Hollywood; thrill to (and laugh at) the further exploits of private eye Dirk Gently and two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox. In the immortal words of The Hitchhiker's Guide, \"Don't panic!\"--though our friend Douglas Adams is hone, he's left us something very special to remember him by. Without a doubt."

When a tollbooth mysteriously appears in his room, he drives through only because he\u2019s got nothing better to do. But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and even embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason! Somewhere along the way, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it\u2019s exciting beyond his wildest dreams. . . ."

        "abstract": "A #1 \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BESTSELLER<br /><br />One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, \"we have no theory.\"<br /><br />Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.<br /><br />Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are."

        "abstract": "The scholarly discipline of Bullshit Studies has blossomed in the last several years, fertilized by a number of critical works on the subject and the growing importance of the issue across a wide range of professions. Now, best-selling author and lifelong practitioner Stanley Bing enters the field with a comprehensive look at the many attractive jobs now available to those who are serious about their bullshit and prepared to dedicate their working life to it.<br /><br />What, Bing inquires, do a feng shui consultant, new media executive, wine steward, department store greeter, and Vice President of the United States have in common? What, too, are the actual duties performed by a McKinsey consultant? Other than sitting around making people nervous? Could that possibly be his core function? Likewise, what does an aromatherapist actually do, per se? Sniff things and rub them on people, for big fragrant bucks? Is that all?<br /><br />The answer in all cases is \"Yes.\" They all have bullshit jobs.<br /><br />These few, of course, are just the beginning. Across the length and breadth of this shrinking globe, skillful bullshit artists have secured pleasant, lucrative employment, and are enjoying themselves more than you are. In virtually every occupation, from Advertising to Yoga Franchising, lucky individuals who \"work\" in these coveted positions enjoy the best lives imaginable -- they are paid well, they rarely break a sweat, and their professions are highly respected, because nobody really knows what they do.<br /><br />At once funny, useful, and tolerably philosophical, this groundbreaking work takes a close look at 100 bullshit jobs -- the money they bring with them, the actual tasks and activities involved (if any), and famous and successful examples of each position, who will provide the neophyte with inspiration. Most crucially, Bing goes on to offer what others so far have not--a clear, concise strategy to help job-seekers at every level reach for that brass ring, knowing full well that it may be attached to the nose of a bull."

        "abstract": "No Conspiracy Theories in This Book-Just a True Story of Spleen Clutching Incompetence, Forehead Slapping Stupidity and Ear Sweating Cowardice. Tough on terrorism? Strong on defense? Leadership? Not quite. Compared to George W. Bush's gutless and incompetent performance on 9/11, Brownie looks like General Patton. The President pulled a FEMA for 102 minutes while al Qaeda struck with impunity-but since W's actions on September 11 were largely ignored by the national media-most people weren't even aware of the little man's 7 minutes of ass sitting paralysis in an elementary school classroom until Michael Moore's film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" exposed the frozen leader of the free world-let alone know about Bush's clueless loitering-cutting and running, and terrorist appeasing for the other 95 minutes of the attacks. Ron Schalow's \"Bullshit Artist\" provides a full account of the President's lollygagging, decision avoiding and hiding in the heartland on the tragic day-in Bush's own words and the tortuously twisty recollections of the White House brain trust-Card, Rove, Fleischer, Hughes, Rice, Cheney &amp; Rumsfeld-plus the traditional bushel basket of excuses that ensue after every Bush failure. And Bush supporters like Bill Sammon, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, John Podhoretz, David Frum and Dick Morris also chime in to provide cover for the cowardly Commander-in-Chief-evidently more concerned about the image of their beloved politician than the security of the American people. Then, as if his flaccid failures on 9/11 weren't shameful enough, a delusional GW boasts of his defense prowess at least 19 times per day in the following years-whoring the terrorist attacks and 3,000 deaths on his watch to his immense political benefit-a Bullshit Artist at his best.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bullshitartist.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bullshitartist.net</a>"

        "abstract": "The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation \"a new birth of freedom\"--by tracing its first birth to the Declaration of Independence (which called all men equal) rather than to the Constitution (which tolerated slavery). In the space of a mere 272 words, Lincoln brought to bear the rhetoric of the Greek Revival, the categories of Transcendentalism, and the imagery of the \"rural cemetery\" movement. His entire life and previous training, his deep political experience, went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece. As Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel has been restored to its bold colors and forgotten details, Garry Wills restores the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln at Gettysburg combines the same extraordinary quality of observation that defines Wills's previous best-selling portraits of modern presidents, such as Reagan's America and Nixon Agonistes, with the iconoclastic scholarship of his studies of our founding documents, such as Inventing America. By examining both the Address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew and reveals much about a President so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world, to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns. The Civil War is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Now Garry Wills explains how Lincoln wove a spell that has not, yet, been broken."

Kennedy</b>, <b>Don DeLillo</b> chronicles <b>Lee Harvey Oswald</b>'s odyssey from troubled teenager to a man of precarious stability who imagines himself an agent of history. When \"history\" presents itself in the form of two disgruntled CIA operatives who decide that an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the president will galvanize the nation against communism, the scales are irrevocably tipped.A gripping, masterful blend of fact and fiction, alive with meticulously portrayed characters both real and created, <b>Libra</b> is a grave, haunting, and brilliant examination of an event that has become an indelible part of the American psyche."

        "abstract": "\"One of the most intelligent, grimly funny voices to comment on life in present-day America\" (<i>The New York Times</i>), Don DeLillo presents an extraordinary new novel about words and images, novelists and terrorists, the mass mind and the arch-individualist. At the heart of the book is Bill Gray, a famous reclusive writer who escapes the failed novel he has been working on for many years and enters the world of political violence, a nightscape of Semtex explosives and hostages locked in basement rooms. Bill's dangerous passage leaves two people stranded: his brilliant, fixated assistant, Scott, and the strange young woman who is Scott's lover\u2014and Bill's."

In the process she is dragged into the black market world of erotica and shady, infatuated men, where a cat-and-mouse chase for an erotic film rumored to \"star\" Adolph Hitler leads to trickery, maneuvering, and bloodshed. With streamlined prose and a thriller's narrative pace, \"Running Dog\" is a bright star in the modern master's early career."

        "abstract": "One of DeLillo's first novels, <b>Ratner's Star</b>\u00a0\u00a0follows Billy, the genius adolescent, who is recruited to live in obscurity, underground, as he tries to help a panel of estranged, demented, and yet lovable scientists communicate with beings from outer space. It is a mix of quirky humor, science, mathematical theories, as well as the complex emotional distance and sadness people feel. <b>Ratner's Star</b> demonstrates both the thematic and prosaic muscularity that typifies DeLillo's later and more recent works, like <i>The Names</i> (which is also available in Vintage Contemporaries)."

The booming times of market optimism\u2014when the culture boiled with money and corporations seemed more vital and influential than governments\u2014are poised to crash. Eric Packer, a billionaire asset manager at age twenty-eight, emerges from his penthouse triplex and settles into his lavishly customized white stretch limousine. Today he is a man with two missions: to pursue a cataclysmic bet against the yen and to get a haircut across town. Stalled in traffic by a presidential motorcade, a music idol\u2019s funeral and a violent political demonstration, Eric receives a string of visitors\u2014experts on security, technology, currency, finance and a few sexual partners\u2014as the limo sputters toward an increasingly uncertain future.<br /><br /><i>Cosmopolis</i>, Don DeLillo\u2019s thirteenth novel, is both intimate and global, a vivid and moving account of the spectacular downfall of one man, and of an era."

Dissatisfied with a life that has brought fame and fortune, he suddenly decides he no longer wants to be a commodity. He leaves his band mid-tour and holes up in a dingy, unfurnished apartment in Great Jones Street. Unfortunately, his disappearing act only succeeds in inflaming interest. As faithful fans await messages, Bucky encounters every sort of roiling force he is trying to escape.<br /><br />DeLillo\u2019s third novel is more than a musical satire: it probes the rights of the individual, foreshadows the struggle of the artist within a capitalist world and delivers a scathing portrait of our culture\u2019s obsession with the lives of the few.<br /><br />\"Brilliant\u2026deeply shocking\u2026 Looks at rock music, nihilism, and urban decay.\" <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo has the force and imagination of Thomas Pynchon or John Barth, with a sense of proportion and style which these would-be giants often lack.\" <i>The Irish Times</i>"

Among the cast of DeLillo's bizarre yet fully realized characters in <b>The Names</b> are Kathryn, the narrator's estranged wife; their son, the six-year-old novelist; Owen, the scientist; and the neurotic narrator obsessed with his own neuroses. A thriller, a mystery, and still a moving examination of family, loss, and the amorphous and magical potential of language itself, <b>The Names</b> stands with any of DeLillo's more recent and highly acclaimed works. <br /><br />\"<b>The Names</b> not only accurately reflects a portion of our contemporary world but, more importantly, an original world of its own is created.\"--<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo sifts experience through simultaneous grids of science and poetry, analysis and clear sight, to make a high-wire prose that is voluptuously stark.\"--<i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo verbally examines every state of consciousness from eroticism to tourism, from the idea of America as conceived by the rest of the world to the idea of the rest of the world as conceived by America, from mysticism to fanaticism.\"--<i>New York Times</i>"

        "abstract": "Spanning the period between the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at the time of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places not strictly speaking on the map at all.<br /><br />With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead, it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred.<br /><br />The sizable cast of characters includes anarchists, balloonists, gamblers, corporate tycoons, drug enthusiasts, innocents and decadents, mathematicians, mad scientists, shamans, psychics, and stage magicians, spies, detectives, adventuresses, and hired guns. There are cameo appearances by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi, and Groucho Marx.<br /><br />As an era of certainty comes crashing down around their ears and an unpredictable future commences, these folks are mostly just trying to pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it's their lives that pursue them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the author is up to his usual business. Characters stop what they're doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs. Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or two. According to some, this is one of the main purposes of fiction.<br /><br />Let the reader decide, let the reader beware. Good luck.<br /><br /><i>--Thomas Pynchon</i><br /><br />About the Author:<br />Thomas Pynchon is the author of <i>V.</i>, <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, <i>Slow Learner</i>, a collection of short stories, <i>Vineland</i> and, most recently, <i>Mason and Dixon</i>.

Here is their story as re-imagined by Thomas Pynchon, featuring Native Americans and frontier folk, ripped bodices, naval warfare, conspiracies erotic and political, major caffeine abuse. We follow the mismatch'd pair--one rollicking, the other depressive; one Gothic, the other pre-Romantic--from their first journey together to the Cape of Good Hope, to pre-Revolutionary America and back, through the strange yet redemptive turns of fortune in their later lives, on a grand tour of the Enlightenment's dark hemisphere, as they observe and participate in the many opportunities for insanity presented them by the Age of Reason.<br /></div>"

Vineland is vintage Pynchon, full of quasi-allegorical characters, elaborate unresolved subplots, corny songs (\"Floozy with an Uzi\"), movie spoofs (Pee-wee Herman in <i>The Robert Musil Story</i>), and illicit sex (including a macho variation on the infamous sportscar scene in <i>V.</i>).<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It includes, among other bizarre artifacts and personalities, reportage on the dark journeys and impulses of the Manson family, a visit to a Black Panther Party press conference, the story of John Paul Getty's museum, a meditation on the romance of water in an arid landscape, and reflections on the swirl and confusion that marked this era. With commanding sureness of mood and language, Didion exposes the realities and dreams of an age of self-discovery whose spiritual center was California. <br />Table of Contents<br />I.

Grace Strasser-Mendana controls much of the country's wealth and knows virtually all of its secrets; Charlotte Douglas knows far too little. \"Immaculate of history, innocent of politics,\" she has come to Boca Grande vaguely and vainly hoping to be reunited with her fugitive daughter. As imagined by Didion, her fate is at once utterly particular and fearfully emblematic of an age of conscienceless authority and unfathomable violence."

A native Californian, Didion applies her scalpel-like intelligence to the state\u2019s ethic of ruthless self-sufficiency in order to examine that ethic\u2019s often tenuous relationship to reality.<br /><br />Combining history and reportage, memoir and literary criticism, <b>Where I Was From</b><i> </i>explores California\u2019s romances with land and water; its unacknowledged debts to railroads, aerospace, and big government; the disjunction between its code of individualism and its fetish for prisons. Whether she is writing about her pioneer ancestors or privileged sexual predators, robber barons or writers (not excluding herself), Didion is an unparalleled observer, and her book is at once intellectually provocative and deeply personal."

        "abstract": "Inez Victor knows that the major casualty of the political life is memory. But the people around Inez have made careers out of losing track. Her senator husband wants to forget the failure of his last bid for the presidency. Her husband's handler would like the press to forget that Inez's father is a murderer. And, in 1975, the year in which much of this bitterly funny novel is set, America is doing its best to lose track of its one-time client, the lethally hemorrhaging republic of South Vietnam.As conceived by Joan Didion, these personages and events constitute the terminal fallout of democracy, a fallout that also includes fact-finding junkets, senatorial groupies, the international arms market, and the Orwellian newspeak of the political class. Moving deftly from Honolulu to Jakarta, between romance, farce, and tragedy, <b>Democracy</b> is a tour de force from a writer who can dissect an entire society with a single phrase."

Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection.<br /><br /><i>Slouching Towards Bethlehem </i>captures the counterculture of the sixties, its mood and lifestyle, as symbolized by California, Joan Baez, Haight-Ashbury. <i>The White Album </i>covers the revolutionary politics and the \u201ccontemporary wasteland\u201d of the late sixties and early seventies, in pieces on the Manson family, the Black Panthers, and Hollywood. <i>Salvador</i> is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. <i>Miami</i> exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In <i>After Henry </i>Didion reports on the Reagans, Patty Hearst, and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in <i>Political Fictions</i>\u2013on censorship in the media, Gingrich, Clinton, Starr, and \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d among others\u2013show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in <i>Where I Was From </i>Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream."

It is where the bitter opera of Cuban exile intersects with the cynicism of U.S. foreign policy. It is a city whose skyrocketing murder rate is fueled by the cocaine trade, racial discontent, and an undeclared war on the island ninety miles to the south. <br /><br />As Didion follows Miami's drift into a Third World capital, she also locates its position in the secret history of the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs to the Reagan doctrine and from the Kennedy assassination to the Watergate break-in. <b>Miami</b> is not just a portrait of a city, but a masterly study of immigration and exile, passion, hypocrisy, and political violence."

Set in a place beyond good and evil - literally in Hollywood, Las Vegas, and the barren wastes of the Mojave Desert, but figuratively in the landscape of an arid soul - it remains more than three decades after its original publication a profoundly disturbing novel, riveting in its exploration of a woman and a society in crisis and stunning in the still-startling intensity of its prose.<br /></div>"

He\u2019s drawn into the streets of New York, onto an elusive case that\u2019s more puzzling and more deeply-layered than anything he might have written himself. In <em>Ghosts</em>, Blue, a mentee of Brown, is hired by White to spy on Black from a window on Orange Street. Once Blue starts stalking Black, he finds his subject on a similar mission, as well. In <em>The Locked Room</em>, Fanshawe has disappeared, leaving behind his wife and baby and nothing but a cache of novels, plays, and poems.<br /><br />This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition includes an introduction from author and professor Luc Sante, as well as a pulp novel-inspired cover from Art Spiegelman, Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic artist of <em>Maus</em> and <em>In the Shadow of No Towers</em>."

As Marco sets out on a journey from the canyons of Manhattan to the deserts of Utah, he encounters a gallery of characters and a series of events as rich and surprising as any in modern fiction.<br /><br />Beginning during the summer that men first walked on the moon, and moving backward and forward in time to span three generations, Moon Palace is propelled by coincidence and memory, and illuminated by marvelous flights of lyricism and wit. Here is the most entertaining and moving novel yet from an author well known for his breathtaking imagination."

        "abstract": "<em>\"One of the most moving accounts of a man trying to come to grips with modern death that is to say, death without God, death without hope of salvation and it reveals the secret meaning of Mallarme's whole aesthetic: the elevation of art to the stature of religion.\"</em> Paul Auster, from the Introduction The great French Symbolist poet Stephane Mallarme (1842-1898), who changed the course of modern French literature (and influenced writers from James Joyce to T.S. Eliot to Wallace Stevens), suffered many tragedies. His mother died when he was just five years old, but in 1879 the cruelest blow of all struck when his beloved son Anatole died at the age of eight. <em>A Tomb for Anatole</em> presents the 202 fragments of Mallarme's projected long poem in four parts. By far the poet's most personal work, he could never bring himself to complete it. To speak publicly of his immense sorrow, Mallarme concluded, \"for me, it's not possible.\" Unpublished in France until 1961, these works are very far from the oblique, cool \"pure poetry\" Mallarme is famous for, poetry that sought to capturepainstakingly\"<em>l'absente de tous bouquets</em>\" (the ideal flower absent from all bouquets). Paul Auster, who first published <em>A Tomb for Anatole</em> with the North Point Press in 1983 (a volume long out of print), notes in his excellent introduction that facing \"the ultimate horror of every parent,\" these fragments \"have a startling unmediated quality.\" As Mallarme writes, it is \"a vision / endlessly purified / by my tears.\""

The treatment of the first speech by the crazy antagonist, Peter Stillman - in which the word balloons trail from random objects such as a broken television and a bottle of ink - is brilliant.<br /><br /><i>Neon Lit: Paul Auster's City of Glass</i> deftly illustrates why comics is a perfect format for exploring fictions about text: the words become visible objects of the story."

But when their plans backfire, Jim and Jack are indentured by their elusive marks and are forced to build a meaningless wall with bricks gathered from ruins of an Irish castle. Time passes, their debts mount, and anger builds as the two struggle to dig themselves out of their Kafkaesque serfdom.<br /><br /><i>New York </i>Times-bestselling author Paul Auster (<i>The New York Trilogy)</i> brings us back into his strange, shape-shifting world of fiendish bargains and punitive whims, where chance is a powerful yet unpredictable force."

With no memory of who he is or how he has arrived there, he pores over the relics on the desk, examining the circumstances of his confinement and searching his own hazy mind for clues.</div>\n  <div><br />Determining that he is locked in, the man--identified only as Mr. Blank--begins reading a manuscript he finds on the desk, the story of another prisoner, set in an alternate world the man doesn't recognize. Nevertheless, the pages seem to have been left for him, along with a haunting set of photographs. As the day passes, various characters call on the man in his cell--vaguely familiar people, some who seem to resent him for crimes he can't remember--and each brings frustrating hints of his identity and his past. All the while an overhead camera clicks and clicks, recording his movements, and a microphone records every sound in the room. Someone is watching.</div>\n  <div><br />Both chilling and poignant, <i>Travels in the Scriptorium</i> is vintage Auster: mysterious texts, fluid identities, a hidden past, and, somewhere, an obscure tormentor. And yet, as we discover during one day in the life of Mr. Blank, his world is not so different from our own.</div>\n</div>"

Ben\u2019s one-time best friend, Peter Aaron, begins to retrospectively investigate the transformation that led Ben from his enviable stable life, to one of a recluse. Both were once intelligent, yet struggling novelists until Ben\u2019s near-death experience falling from a fire escape triggers a tumble in which he becomes withdrawn and disturbed, living alone and building bombs in a far-off cabin. That is, until he mysteriously disappears, leaving behind only a manuscript titled <i>Leviathan</i>, pages rustling in the wind."

To my knowledge, no current anthology is as full and as deftly edited.\"--Peter Brooks, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />\"One of the freshest and most exciting books of poetry to appear in a long while . . . Paul Auster has provided the best possible point of entry into this century's most influential body of poetry.\"--Geoffrey O'Brien, <i>The Village Voice</i>"

This book is produced with fold-out pages featuring Thomas's screen prints alongside the text of Auster and is packaged in a box. Auster and Thomas first collaborated in 2002. Thomas showed Auster some of his work and suggested a graphic arts project that would combine an Auster text with a series of drawings. Auster liked the idea and asked Thomas to choose one of his texts. A text was selected from The New York Trilogy\u2014City of Glass, a very moving and intense section, which Thomas called \"\"The Peter Stillman Monologue.\"\" In December of 2003, a limited edition linen portfolio was printed that contained 8 twocolor silkscreen prints plus a signed colophon. Both Auster and Thomas were so pleased with the results that they decided to do a second project, the result of which is The I er Life of Martin Frost. This is a Rozenberg Title."

In <em>The Red Notebook</em>, Auster again explores events from the real world large and small, tragic and comic\u2014that reveal the unpredictable, shifting nature of human experience. A burnt onion pie, a wrong number, a young boy struck by lightning, a man falling off a roof, a scrap of paper discovered in a Paris hotel room\u2014all these form the context for a singular kind of <em>ars poetica</em>, a literary manifesto without theory, cast in the irreducible forms of pure story telling."

        "abstract": "Paul Auster's penetrating and charged verse resembles little else in recent American poetry. This collection of Auster's poetry, translations, and composition notes from early in his career do much to reinforce the idea that Paul Auster is, indeed, a unique and masterful figure in the literary world. Taut, densely lyrical, and everywhere informed by a powerful and subtle music, this selection of writings begins with the compact verse fragments of \"Spokes\" (written when Auster was in his early twenties) and \"Unearth,\" continues on through the more ample meditations of \"Wall Writing, Disappearances, Effigies, Fragments From the Cold, Facing the Music,\" and \"White Spaces,\" then moves further back in time to include Auster's revealing translations of many of the French poets who influenced his own writing, as well as the provocative and previously unpublished ?Notes From A Composition Book? (1967). An introduction by Norman Finkelstein connects biographical elements to a consideration of the work, and takes in Auster's early literary and philosophical influences.<br /><br />Powerful, haunting, and precise, this view from the past to the present will appeal to those unfamiliar with this aspect of Auster's work, as well as those already acquainted with his poetry."

        "abstract": "Paul Auster published his first prose work, the autobiographical <i>The Invention of Solitude</i>, in 1982; since then his fiction has gained ever growing popular and critical acclaim. This book is a stimulating pioneering study of eight works that make up the Auster canon: <i>The Invention of Solitude</i>, the three novellas that comprise <i>The New York Trilogy</i>, and the novels <i>In the Country of Last Things, Moon Palace, The Music of Chance</i>, and <i>Leviathan</i>. Focusing on the quest - which she sees as the master narrative of all of Auster's novels - Shiloh examines Auster's writing in a multi-layered context of literary and philosophical paradigms relevant to his practice, such as the American tradition of the \ufffdopen road, \ufffd the generic conventions of detective fiction, postmodernist concepts of the subject, Sartre's and Camus's existentialist theories, and Freud's and Lacan's psychoanalytic models, all of which offer enriching and insightful perspectives on Auster's poetics."

        "abstract": "<i>An Art of Desire. Reading Paul Auster</i> the first book-length study solely devoted to the novels of Paul Auster. From the vantage-point of poststructuralist theory, especially Lacanian psychoanalysis and Derridean deconstruction, this book explores the relation of Auster's novels <i>City of Glass, In the Country of Last Things, Moon Palace, </i> and <i>The Music of Chance</i> to the rewriting and deconstruction of genre conventions; their connections to concepts such as catastrophe theory, the sublime, Freud's notion of the 'death drive;' as well as the philosophical underpinnings of his work. At the focus of this study, however, is the concept of desire, an important concept in the writings of both Auster and Lacan, and the various manifestations of this concept in Auster's novels. Auster's novels always emphasize a kind of outside of the text (chance, the real, the unsayable), a kind of hope for a 'transparent language, ' a hope, however, that is exactly posited as impossible to fulfill. The relation of Daniel Quinn, Anna Blume, Marco Fogg and Jim Nashe to this lack is the motor of their desire, the driving force for the subject that has <i>always already</i> left the real and has been inscribed into the representational system called 'reality.' It is here, in its relation to the signifier, that the subject's desire is played out, that its experience is ordered, interpreted, and articulated. It is their ability to make connections, to proliferate, to 'affirm free-play, ' their ability 'not to bemoan the absence of the centre' that ultimately decides over success or failure of Auster's subjects - whether they partake in the 'joyous errance of the sign, ' or whether their fate is that of the 'unfortunate traveler.'"

The Art of Hunger undermines and expands our accepted notions about literature and throws an uprecedented light on his own richly allusive writing."

It explores the rich literary and cultural sources that Auster taps into in order to create compelling stories that investigate the nature of language, the workings of chance, and the individual\u2019s complex relations with the world at large. Whereas most Auster criticism has concentrated on readings of individual novels, this book emphasizes the continuity in Auster\u2019s writing by discussing throughout the philosophical underpinnings that lead the author to question the boundaries separating the fictional from the factual, and the real from the imagined."

In <i>Beyond the Red Notebook</i>, the first book devoted to the works of Auster, Dennis Barone has assembled an international group of scholars who present twelve essays that provide a rich and insightful examination of Auster's writings.<br /><br />The authors explore connections between Auster's poetry and fiction, the philosophical underpinnings of his writing, its relation to detective fiction, and its unique embodiment of the postmodern sublime. Their essays provide the fullest analysis available of Auster's themes of solitude, chance, and paternity found in works such as <i>The Invention of Solitude</i>, <i>City of Glass</i>, <i>Ghosts</i>, <i>The Locked Room</i>, <i>In the Country of Last Things</i>, <i>Moon Palace</i>, <i>The Music of Chance</i>, and <i>Leviathan</i>.<br /><br />This volume includes contributions from Pascal Bruckner, Marc Chenetier, Norman Finkelstein, Derek Rubin, Madeleine Sorapure, Stephen Bernstein, Tim Woods, Steven Weisenburger, Arthur Saltzman, Eric Wirth, and Motoyuki Shibata. The extensive bibliography, prepared by William Drenttel, will greatly benefit both scholars and general readers."

        "abstract": "Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, <i>Collapse</i> is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?<br /><br />In his million-copy bestseller <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, Jared Diamond examined how and why Western civilizations developed the technologies and immunities that allowed them to dominate much of the world. Now in this brilliant companion volume, Diamond probes the other side of the equation: What caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin, and what can we learn from their fates?<br /><br />As in <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe. Environmental damage, climate change, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of these societies, but other societies found solutions and persisted. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society's apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana.<br /><br />Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, <i>Collapse</i> is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?"

This seemingly small phenomenon symbolizes a significant social change that Robert Putnam has identified in this brilliant volume, which <i>The Economist</i> hailed as \"a prodigious achievement.\"<br /><br />Drawing on vast new data that reveal Americans' changing behavior, Putnam shows how we have become increasingly disconnected from one another and how social structures--whether they be PTA, church, or political parties--have disintegrated. Until the publication of this groundbreaking work, no one had so deftly diagnosed the harm that these broken bonds have wreaked on our physical and civic health, nor had anyone exalted their fundamental power in creating a society that is happy, healthy, and safe.<br /><br />Like defining works from the past, such as <i>The Lonely Crowd</i> and <i>The Affluent Society, </i> and like the works of C. Wright Mills and Betty Friedan, Putnam's <i>Bowling Alone</i> has identified a central crisis at the heart of our society and suggests what we can do."

        "abstract": "In pursuit of fairness at any cost, we have created a society paralyzed by legal fear: Doctors are paranoid and principals powerless. Little league coaches, scared of liability, stop volunteering. Schools and hospitals start to crumble. The common good fades, replaced by a cacophony of people claiming their \"individual rights.\"<br /><br />By turns funny and infuriating, this startling book dissects the dogmas of fairness that allow self-interested individuals to bully the rest of society. Philip K. Howard explains how, trying to honor individual rights, we removed the authority needed to maintain a free society. Teachers don't even have authority to maintain order in the classroom. With no one in charge, the safe course is to avoid any possible risk. Seesaws and diving boards are removed. Ridiculous warning labels litter the American landscape: \"Caution: Contents Are Hot.\"<br /><br />Striving to protect \"individual rights,\" we ended up losing much of our freedom. When almost any decision that someone disagrees with is a possible lawsuit, no one knows where he stands. A huge monument to the unknown plaintiff looms high above America, casting a dark shadow across our daily choices. Today, in the land of free speech, you'd have to be a fool to say what you really think.<br /><br />This provocative book not only attacks the sacred cows of political correctness, but takes a breathtakingly bold stand on how to reinvigorate our common good. Only by restoring personal authority can schools begin to work again. Only by judges and legislatures taking back the authority to decide who can sue for what can doctors feel comfortable using their best judgment and American be liberated to say and do what they know is right. Lucid, honest, and hard hitting, <i>The Collapse of the Common Good</i> shows how Americans can bring back freedom and common sense to a society disabled by lawyers and legal fear."

        "abstract": "In the Cold War era that dominated the second half of the twentieth century, nobody envisaged that the collapse of the Soviet Union would come from within, still less that it would happen meekly, without global conflagration.<br /> In this brilliantly compact, original, engaging book, Stephen Kotkin shows that the Soviet collapse resulted not from military competition but, ironically, from the dynamism of Communist ideology, the long-held dream for \"socialism with a human face.\" The neo-liberal reforms in post-Soviet Russia never took place, nor could they have, given the Soviet-era inheritance in the social, political, and economic landscape. Kotkin takes us deep into post-Stalin Soviet society and institutions, into the everyday hopes and secret political intrigues that affected 285 million people, before and after 1991. He conveys the high drama of a superpower falling apart while armed to the teeth with millions of loyal troops and tens of thousands of weapons of mass destruction. Armageddon Averted vividly demonstrates the overriding importance of history, individual ambition, geopolitics, and institutions, and deftly draws out contemporary Russia's contradictory predicament."

Experts predict that the number could drop to twenty by the middle of the century. Before they disappear completely, journalist Elizabeth Seay set out to track down what is left of these languages in her native Oklahoma. Her deeply felt narrative opens a window onto the quirks and intricacies of each language she encountered--and allows a glimpse into the last days of a vanishing culture.<br /><br />Seay finds a \"lost city\": Ross Mountain, a secret community in the Ozark Mountains where 90 percent of the people, from young to old, speak a Cherokee dialect as their first language. She meets leaders in the Indian community, from Toby Hughes, who weaves spells, to Charles Chibitty, the last Comanche code talker, and his granddaughter Lacey, for whom being a Comanche seems to be a weekend hobby. The result of Seay's journey is less a study in linguistics than a lively history lesson in cultural migration, forced assimilation, and the meaning of language itself. <br />"

        "abstract": "Plains Indians from different tribes speaking different languages were nevertheless able to communicate facts and feelings of considerable complexity when they met. They used a language composed of gestures made almost entirely with the hands and fingers, probably the most highly developed gesture language to be found in any part of the world.<br />With this book, you will find it simple to use this language, which the author learned in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, principally from Sioux Indians in Wyoming. Drawings and short descriptions make clear the proper positions and motions of the hands to convey the meaning of over 870 alphabetically arranged common words \u2014 hungry, camp, evening, angry, fire, laugh, owl, cat, many times, brave, cold, heart, rain, spotted, together, river, etc. The words are then used in sample sentences. There are also brief sections on the pictography and ideography of the Sioux and Ojibway tribes, and on smoke signals.<br />This is a book for anyone who wants to learn or teach Indian sign language \u2014 scouts, school teachers, camp counselors, scout leaders, parents, linguists, and students of Indian culture. To help counselors and teachers, the last chapters give instructions on how to conduct the Indian ceremony for opening a council fire, an Indian initiation ceremony, and suggestions for sign language tests and exercises."

        "abstract": "Nikola Tesla's Electricity Unplugged is a unique anthology of hand-picked Tesla articles, arranged historically, which presents overwhelming and convincing evidence for the reality of Tesla's high efficiency, low cost wireless power transmission. Following in the footsteps of the editor's first book in the series, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature, Dr. Tom Valone's book chronologically traces the original intention that Nikola Tesla had for his wireless electricity and how he updated and expanded upon it later on, with reprints of his key articles, to the recent genius engineers and physicists who are now finally bringing this last and most elusive, highly advanced Tesla technology into reality. The Corum article (along with the Peterson article) on the Zenneck wave transmission experiments culminates the viewpoints of all of the book's contributors. Its purposeful placement as the last chapter of the book, is because this exclusive article publication is a major scientific breakthrough, as testified by the book's endorsement from Brigadier General Michael Miller, and foretells the understandable, visionary road to the corporate formation of wireless power utilities. Furthermore, this is the first and only book in the world which explains how an electromagnetic wave traveling across the electrically conductive surface of the earth, was predicted by Tesla and Zenneck (two pictures in the book show them together on pages 74 and 381) and why it is the essential missing link of any Tesla wireless transmission theory. Many of the contributors also nicely explain the \"surface wave phenomenon\" as well as \"resonant earth-ionosphere\" modes of electrical transmission without wires that compliments the surface wave theory and experiment. Nikola Tesla's Electricity Unplugged therefore is a treasure compared to any other Tesla reference book currently in print, since it is jam-packed with personal stories of Tesla, such as one reprinted from the prestigious Smithsonian magazine, along with great illustrated slideshows adapted for the book format, the \"secret\" history of Tesla's wireless, the real Tesla electric car, high Q resonant power transfer examples being used today by Qualcomm, \"Tesla unplugged\" explained in an easy-to-understand presentation by a Brookhaven National Lab scientist, wireless electricity article based on scalar waves, even including a couple amazing rigorous equation articles with wireless solutions for the tech audience, a unique and evocative Foreword by Nikola Tesla's last living direct descendant, all presented in a 457-page paperback book, suitable as a college or high school reader, or simply as an eye-opening, optimistic window onto the electrical genius regarded as the \"Master of Lightning,\" with a priceless collection of nineteen (19) contributors not available anywhere else."

The evidence is overwhelming!Discredited in his time, Nikola Tesla was made out by business competitors and the government to be nothing more than a kook. Nonetheless, the same conspirators later duplicated -- and possibly even stole -- many of Tesla's most fabulous inventions which could soon change the course of history as well as our lives! EXPOSED. . . * Reverse Gravity. * Free Energy. * Contact With Hidden Dimensions. * Mysterious Signals From Space. * Earth Changes. * Freak Weather. * Electric Death Rays. * UFOS. * Partical Beam Weapons. Put into Top-Secret use by agents of the New World Order and the global political monetary elite, many of Tesla most powerful and potentially dangerous scientific discoveries are being turned against ordinary citizens in programs of behavior and physical modification. This is being done to influence our critical thinking and belief patterns to make us more susceptible to the mental commands of the Secret Government.One of the most recognizable of these sinister programs is the seeding of clouds with mind and body altering chemicals. These mysterious chemtrails (as they are called) have been widely seen and photographed as they cris-cross the sky in bewildering patterns. Tesla fought all his life against the \"Evil Empire\" which is emerging as a fire breathing dragon as we get pushed head first into the new millennium."

Tesla's rare article, 'The Problem of Increasing Human Energy with Special Reference to the Harnessing of the Sun's Energy' is included. This lengthy article was originally publishing in the June 1900 issue of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine and it was the outline for Tesla's master blueprint for the world. Tesla's fantastic vision of the future, including wireless power, anti-gravity, free energy and highly advanced solar power. Also included are some of the papers, patents and material collected on Tesla at the Colorado Spring Tesla Symposiums. Tesla was the inventor of the radio before Marconi, and when he demonstrated wireless remote control to the US Navy in the late 1890s, they replied that it was too advanced! Tesla was an eccentric visionary and probably the greatest inventor who ever lived. His basic inventions power the world of today. What was his vision of tomorrow? Find out in The Tesla Papers."

In truth, light bulbs, airplanes, steam engines--these objects are the end results, the fruits, of vast aggregates of invention. They are not invention itself. <br /> In How Invention Begins, Lienhard reconciles the ends of invention with the individual leaps upon which they are built, illuminating the vast web of individual inspirations that lie behind whole technologies. He traces, for instance, the way in which thousands of people applied their combined inventive genius to airplanes, railroad engines, and automobiles. As he does so, it becomes clear that a collective desire, an upwelling of fascination, a spirit of the times--a Zeitgeist--laid its hold upon inventors. The thing they all sought to create was speed itself. <br /> Likewise, Lienhard shows that when we trace the astonishingly complex technology of printing books, we come at last to that which we desire from books--the knowledge, the learning, that they provide. Can we speak of speed or education as inventions? To do so, he concludes, is certainly no greater a stretch than it is to call radio or the telephone an \"invention.\" <br /> Throughout this marvelous volume, Lienhard illuminates these processes, these webs of insight or inspiration, by weaving a fabric of anecdote, history, and technical detail--all of which come together to provide a full and satisfying portrait of the true nature of invention."

Not until the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century did war come to be regarded as an unmitigated evil and one that could be abolished by rational social organization, and only after the massive slaughter of the two world wars did this become the declared objective of civilized states. Nevertheless, war in one form or another continues unabated. In this elegantly written book, a preeminent military historian considers why this is so.<br />Is war in some sense still a necessary element in international order? Are war and peace in fact complementary? Does not peace itself breed the conditions that will ultimately lead to war? And if nuclear weapons have made war ultimately suicidal for mankind, what can be done about it? Having devoted half a century largely to studying these questions, Michael Howard offers us his reflections. Unless they can be answered, he notes, the twenty-first century is unlikely to be any more peaceful than the centuries that preceded it."

        "abstract": "Many of the traditions which we think of as very ancient in their origins were not in fact sanctioned by long usage over the centuries, but were invented comparative recently. This book explores examples of this process of invention - the creation of Welsh Scottish 'national culture'; the elaboration of British royal rituals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the origins of imperial ritual in British India and Africa; and the attempts by radical movements to develop counter-traditions of their own. This book addresses the complex interaction of past and present, bringing together historicans and anthropologists in a fascinating study of ritual and symbolism which possess new questions for the understanding of our history."

        "abstract": "It is 1936 and A.E. Housman is being ferried across the river Styx, glad to be dead at last. His memories are dramatically alive. The river that flows through Tom Stoppard's The Invention of Love connects Hades with the Oxford of Housman's youth: High Victorian morality is under siege from the Aesthetic movement, and an Irish student called Wilde is preparing to burst onto the London scene. On his journey the scholar and poet who is now the elder Housman confronts his younger self, and the memories of the man he loved his entire life, Moses Jackson - the handsome athlete who could not return his feelings. As if a dream, The Invention of Love inhabits Housman's imagination, illuminating both the pain of hopeless love and passion displaced into poetry and the study of classical texts. The author of A Shropshire Lad lived almost invisibly in the shadow of the flamboyant Oscar Wilde, and died old and venerated - but whose passion was truly the fatal one?"

        "abstract": "It's not fair! Thirteen-year-old Joelle Cunningham is passionate about baseball. But when her family moves to the small town of Greendale, Iowa, she quickly discovers that there are strict rules preventing her from playing on the school baseball team.<br />At Hoover Middle School, only boys play baseball. Girls play softball. Joelle tries to tell everyone they're not the same sport. But no one is listening. Not Coach Carlyle who doesn't want her on his team even though his baseball team is at the bottom of the league. Not Ms. Fenner, the softball coach who wants Joelle to use her big league swing on the girls' team. Not even Jason, her older brother, who is too busy at college to be of much help.<br />But Joelle is determined to play baseball. Through some creative problem-solving and surprising alliances, she finds a solution to her dilemma that brings the disputing sides together...and baseball to the girls of Greendale.<br />Author Dori Butler has created a high-spirited, indomitable character that young girls will admire and root for in this story of frustrated ambition and ultimate triumph."

        "abstract": "As the Civil War ended, the thoughts of many Northern soldiers turned to a game that some had learned about for the first time during the war--baseball. Their newfound interest in the sport, combined with the postwar economic boom and the resultant growth of many cities, took the game from one practiced by a few amateur clubs in New York City before the war to a professional sport covering almost the entire northeastern United States. Researched from primary sources, the game of the late 1860s is described season-by-season: the fields, the crowds, the strategy, the rules, the style of play, and the confusing struggles to crown a national champion, with all the chicanery and machinations of the contenders. Such landmark events as the Washington Nationals' pioneering 1867 tour and the Cincinnati Red Stockings' undefeated 1869 season are covered."

        "abstract": "Ruby is an increasingly popular, fully object-oriented dynamic programming language, hailed by many practitioners as the finest and most useful language available today. When Ruby first burst onto the scene in the Western world, the Pragmatic Programmers were there with the definitive reference manual, <i>Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</i>.<br /><br />Now in its second edition, author Dave Thomas has expanded the famous Pickaxe book with over 200 pages of new content, covering all the improved language features of Ruby 1.8 and standard library modules. The Pickaxe contains four major sections:<br /><br /><br />An acclaimed tutorial on using Ruby.<br />The definitive reference to the language.<br />Complete documentation on all built-in classes, modules, and methods<br />Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries.<br /><br /><br />If you enjoyed the First Edition, you'll appreciate the expanded content, including enhanced coverage of installation, packaging, documenting Ruby source code, threading and synchronization, and enhancing Ruby's capabilities using C-language extensions. Programming for the World Wide Web is easy in Ruby, with new chapters on XML/RPC, SOAP, distributed Ruby, templating systems, and other web services. There's even a new chapter on unit testing.<br /><br />This is the definitive reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including more than 250 significant changes since the First Edition). Coverage of other features has grown tremendously, including details on how to harness the sophisticated capabilities of irb, so you can dynamically examine and experiment with your running code. \"Ruby is a wonderfully powerful and useful language, and whenever I'm working with it this book is at my side\" --Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks"

But can you justify the move away from established platforms such as J2EE? Bruce Tate's <i>From Java to Ruby</i> has the answers, and it expresses them in a language that'll help persuade managers and executives who've seen it all. See when and where the switch makes sense, and see how to make it.<br /><br />If you're trying to adopt Ruby in your organization and need some help, this is the book for you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Based on a decision tree (a concept familiar to managers and executives,) <i>Java to Ruby</i> stays above the low-level technical debate to examine the real benefits and risks to adoption.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Java to Ruby</i> is packed with interviews of Ruby customers and developers, so you can see what types of projects are likely to succeed, and which ones are likely to fail. Ruby and Rails may be the answer, but first you need to be sure you're asking the right question. By addressing risk and fitness of purpose, <i>Java to Ruby</i> makes sure you're asking the right questions first.<br /><br /><br /><br />Because technology adoption is only the beginning, <i>Java to Ruby</i> walks you through the whole lifecycle of prototype, ramp up, and production and deployment."

        "abstract": "William Golding's classic novel of primitive savagery and survival is one of the most vividly realized and riveting works in modern fiction. The tale begins after a plane wreck deposits a group of English school boys, aged six to twelve on an isolated tropical island. Their struggle to survive and impose order quickly evolves from a battle against nature into a battle against their own primitive instincts. Golding's portrayal of the collapse of social order into chaos draws the fine line between innocence and savagery."

        "abstract": "Provocative military historian Victor Davis Hanson has given painstakingly researched &amp; pathbreaking accounts of wars ranging from classical antiquity to the 21st century. Now he juxtaposes an ancient conflict with modern concerns to create his most engrossing work to date, A War Like No Other. Over the course of a generation, the Hellenic poleis of Athens &amp; Sparta fought a bloody conflict that resulted in the collapse of Athens &amp; the end of its golden age. Thucydides wrote the standard history of the Peloponnesian War, which has given readers throughout the ages a vivid &amp; authoritative narrative. But Hanson offers something new: a complete chronological account that reflects the political background of the time, the strategic thinking of the combatants, the misery of battle in multifaceted theaters &amp; insight into how these events echo in the present. He compellingly portrays the ways Athens &amp; Sparta fought on land &amp; sea, in city &amp; countryside, &amp; details their employment of the full scope of conventional &amp; nonconventional tactics, from sieges to targeted assassinations, torture &amp; terrorism. He also assesses the crucial roles played by warriors such as Pericles &amp; Lysander, artists, among them Aristophanes, &amp; thinkers including Sophocles &amp; Plato. Hanson\u2019s perceptive analysis of events &amp; personalities raises many thought-provoking questions: Were Athens &amp; Sparta like America &amp; Russia, two superpowers battling to the death? Is the Peloponnesian War echoed in the endless, frustrating conflicts of Vietnam, Northern Ireland &amp; the current Middle East? Or was it more like America\u2019s own Civil War, a brutal rift that rent the fabric of a glorious society, or even this century\u2019s \u201cred state\u2014blue state\u201d schism between liberals &amp; conservatives, a cultural war that manifestly controls military policies? Hanson daringly brings the facts to life &amp; unearths the often surprising ways in which the past informs the present. Brilliantly researched, dynamically written, A War Like No Other is like no other history of this important war."

        "abstract": "Previous biographies of John F. Kennedy have been based almost entirely on newspaper files and personal recollections. Geoffrey Perret's <i>Jack</i> is both the first comprehensive one-volume biography of JFK and the first account of his life based on the extensive and important documentary record that has finally become available, including Kennedy's personal diaries, hundreds of hours of taped conversations from the White House, recently declassified government documents, extensive family correspondence, and crucial interviews sealed for nearly forty years. The result is a gripping, accurate, and ultimately moving portrait of America's most charismatic president.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> provides much-needed context and perspective on Kennedy's bewilderingly complex personality. It offers an even-handed account of the seamy side of his life - orgies and abortions, health and drug problems-along with valuable insights into JFK's truly idealistic and visionary character.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> presents a compelling account of the volatile relationship between Kennedy and his wife, including Jackie's attempt to divorce him, move to Hollywood, and become a film star. At the same time Perret explains how, together, they created the Kennedy style.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> reveals how the restless, innovative Kennedy was able to overturn more than a hundred years of political tradition, forge the modern political campaign, and, once in the White House, modernize the presidency. His success was so complete that all serious presidential candidates since 1960 have sought to compare themselves to JFK, not challenging his legacy but embracing it.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> is filled, too, with numerous revelations, such as the true story behind the lobotomy of JFK's sister Rosemary. And here, for the first time, is a comprehensive account of Kennedy's numerous and varied ailments from childhood on, including his back problems.<br /><br />Perret describes how JFK got the two most important decisions of his administration right: his handling of the Cuban missile crisis and his stance on civil rights. As to Vietnam, Kennedy did not believe it was worth fighting for, and in the last months of his presidency he began formulating a secret plan for neutralization and withdrawal-if he won the 1964 election. But that, of course, was not to be: Convinced he would die young, Kennedy foresaw that a violent death would claim him. Throughout his brief time in the White House he was haunted by a vision of a man standing at a window, looking down at him, holding a rifle.<br /><br /><i>Jack: A Life Like No Other</i> is a book like no other. Here, at last, John F. Kennedy seems to step off the page in all his vitality, charm, and originality."

Written by top technology experts at VERITAS Software Global Corporation, this book takes readers through all facets of storage networking, explaining how a SAN can help consolidate conventional server storage onto networks, how it makes applications highly available no matter how much data is being stored, and how this in turn makes data access and management faster and easier. System and network managers considering storage networking for their enterprises, as well as application developers and IT staff, will find invaluable advice on the design and deployment of the technology and how it works. Detailed, up-to-date coverage includes:<br /><br /><br />The evolution of the technology and what is expected from SANs Killer applications for SANs Full coverage of storage networking and what it means for the enterprise's information processing architecture Individual chapters devoted to the storage, network, and software components of storage networking Issues for implementation and adoption"

        "abstract": "THE MODERN GENTLEMAN is a visually stimulating, rib-tickling, thought-provoking sourcebook of manners and mischief for the 21st-century male. The book offers a panoramic snapshot of the gentleman: witty and poignant, traditional but spontaneous, flirtatious yet courting. Discussions range from the classic (Motoring, Oenophilia) and serious (Secrets &amp; Lies, The Good Husband), to the racy (Kink &amp; Fetish, To the Power of 3) and silly (Bumper Stickers, Fonzarelli Moves &amp; Legerdemain ). And since it is inevitable that a gentleman will dabble in the friskier areas of excess, trouble, and chance, the book's naughty nucleus, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Potent Gentleman,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 explores leisure and dalliance, from alcohol and snuff to recreational botanicals and sex.All men aspire to be perpetually dapper, fluent in three languages, and hit 300-yard drives off the blue tees, not to mention quote poetry by the stanza and win a back-alley scrap. However, there is a dashing plateau more desirable than Hollywood perfection, a level of gallantry that makes one stand out, even in the elevator. So knot up your ascot, pour a glass of sherry, and crack open the MODERN GENTLEMAN: your Man Cycle is peaking."

Now, learn how to adjust your gloves with the correct degree of insouciance, how to behave at the revolutionary dinner table, and what items to pack in your anarcho-dandyist toolkit. Once you have mastered the sartorial and behavioral basics, you can move on to more advanced tactics, like The Trouser Semaphore and Random Acts of Common Courtesy.

        "abstract": "This book is your indispensable guide to cutting-edge CSS developmentall you need to work your way up to CSS professional. You'll learn how to: <br />- Plan, organize, and maintain your stylesheets more effectively<br />- Apply the secrets of liquid, elastic, and hybrid layouts<br />- Create flickr-style image maps, remote rollovers, and other advanced CSS features<br />- Lay out forms using pure CSS<br />- Recognize common browser bugs, and how to fix them<br /><br /><br />While CSS is a relatively simple technology to learn, it is a difficult one to master. When you first start developing sites using CSS, you will come across all kinds of infuriating browser bugs and inconsistencies. It sometimes feels like there are a million and one different techniques to master, spread across a bewildering array of websites. The range of possibilities seems endless and makes for a steep and daunting learning curve. By bringing all of the latest tips, tricks, and techniques together in one handy reference, this book demystifies the secrets of CSS and makes the journey to CSS mastery as simple and painless as possible. While most books concentrate on basic skills, this one is different, assuming that you already know the basics and why you should be using CSS in your work, and concentrating mainly on advanced techniques. It begins with a brief recap of CSS fundamentals such as the importance of meaningful markup, how to structure and maintain your code, and how the CSS layout model really works. With the basics out of the way, each subsequent chapter details a particular aspect of CSS-based design. Through a series of easy-to-follow tutorials, you will learn practical CSS techniques you can immediately start using in your daily work. Browser inconsistencies are the thorn in most CSS developers' sides, so we have dedicated two whole chapters to CSS hacks, filters, and bug fixing, as well as looking at image replacement; professional link, form, and list styling; pure CSS layouts; and much more. All of these techniques are then put into practice in two beautifully designed case studies, written by two of the world's best CSS designers, Simon Collison and Cameron Moll. <br /><br /><br />Summary of Contents: <br />- Chapter 1: Setting the Foundations<br />- Chapter 2: Visual Formatting Model Recap<br />- Chapter 3: Background Images and Image Replacement<br />- Chapter 4: Styling Links<br />- Chapter 5: Styling Lists and Creating Nav Bars<br />- Chapter 6: Styling Forms and Data Tables<br />- Chapter 7: Layout<br />- Chapter 8: Hacks and Filters<br />- Chapter 9: Bugs and Bug Fixing<br />- Case Study 1: More Than Doodles<br />- Case Study 2: Tuscany Luxury Resorts"

        "abstract": "Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert? Then it's about time you picked up <i>Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML</i> and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans, and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your Web pages over time, and so your web pages work in all the browsers and mobile devices out there. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay - we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999 - but if you're going to create Web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS.<br /><br />Learn the real secrets of creating Web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet.<br /><br />With <i>Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML</i>, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML, CSS, and XHTML into your brain in a way that sticks.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville. Your tour is about to begin.<br /><br />\"Elegant design is at the core of every chapter here, each concept conveyed with equal doses of pragmatism and wit.\" --Ken Goldstein, Executive Vice President, Disney Online<br /><br />\"This book is a thoroughly modern introduction to forward-looking practices in web page markup and presentation.\" --Danny Goodman, author of <i>Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide</i><br /><br />\"What used to be a long trial and error learning process has now been reduced neatly into an engaging paperback.\" --Mike Davidson, CEO, Newsvine, Inc.<br /><br />\"I love <i>Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML</i>--it teaches you everything you need to learn in a 'fun coated' format!\" --Sally Applin, UI Designer and Artist<br /><br />\"I haven't had as much fun reading a book (other than Harry Potter) in years. And your book finally helped me break out of my hapless so-last-century way of creating web pages.\" --Professor David M. Arnow, Department of Computer and Information Science, Brooklyn College<br /><br />\"If you've ever had a family member who wanted you to design a website for them, buy them Head First HTML with CSS and XHTML. If you've ever asked a family member to design you a web site, buy this book. If you've ever bought an HTML book and ended up using it to level your desk, or for kindling on a cold winter day, buy this book. This is the book you've been waiting for. This is the learning system you've been waiting for.\" --Warren Kelly, Blogcritics.org"

Many major organizations have been adopting CSS technology e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wired.com</a>."

        "abstract": "A fascinating survey of cover art (TASCHEN's 25th anniversary special edition), record covers are a sign of our life and times. Like the music on the discs, they address such issues as love, life, death, fashion, and rebellion. For music fans the covers are the expression of a period, of a particular time in their lives. Many are works of art and have become as famous as the music they stand for such as Andy Warhol's covers, for example, including the banana he designed for The Velvet Underground. This special edition of <b>Record Covers</b> presents a selection of the best 60s to 90s rock album covers from music archivist, disc jockey, journalist, and ex-record publicity executive Michael Ochs's enormous private collection. Both a trip down memory lane and a study in the evolution of cover art, this is a sweeping look at an under-appreciated art form.<br /><br />This edition is in English, French and German."

Overwhelming in its magnitude, this project is truly extraordinary. <p>Stopping in over 150 countries in all corners of the world, Ommer carefully selected the families which best reflected each society's traditions and social conditions. Many of the portraits have appeared in exhibitions and magazines during the course of the project; now that the work is finished, TASCHEN brings it all to you in one volume. </p><p>Ommer chose to photograph each family in the same way, against a white background and with identical lighting. All of the traditional elements of a documentary photograph are removed, leaving only the people themselves. The result is astonishing.</p><p>382282335X The passing of every old man or woman means the passing of some tradition, some knowledge of sacred rites possessed by no other; consequently the information that is to be gathered, for the benefit of future generations, respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost for all time. </p><p>At the turn of the century the American photographer Edward Sheriff Curtis (1868-1952) started on his thirty year project to produce a monumental study of North American Indians. Using an approach that was both artistically and scientifically ambitious he recorded, in words and pictures, the traces of the traditional Indian way of life that was already beginning to die out. </p><p>With tireless personal commitment Curtis visited American Indian tribes from the Mexican border to the Bering Straits, gaining their confidence by his patience and sensitivity. This, his photographiclife's work, was printed in 20 volumes between 1907 and 1930 as The North American Indian. The quality of reproduction of the photographs was excellent. There were only 272 copies in total. Now all his photographs are fully reproduced in this one book, together with a selection of pictures from Curtis' texts.</p>"

An art form that has grown hand-in-hand with the independent music scene, heralding small and large gigs alike, the posters have emerged from visually creative street-level notices to prized collectibles rendered in a variety of styles and media. Today's poster artists combine the expressive freedom pioneered in the poster revolution of the 1960s with the attitude and the do-it-yourself approach of the punk scene, creating an unprecedented surge of innovative poster production on an international scale. Featuring over 1,600 exemplary rock posters and flyers from over 200 international studios and artists, <i>Art of Modern Rock</i> is the long-anticipated sequel to coauthor Paul Grushkin's <i>The Art of Rock</i>. Profiles and quotes from the pioneers in the field and their emerging heirs share nearly 500 gloriously packed pages of poster after mind-blowing poster. As brash and colorful as the burgeoning scene it documents, <i>Art of Modern Rock</i> is the must-have book for music and poster fans and collectors."

        "abstract": "What does rock art say about gender and how can our understanding of gender shape the way that we view rock art? A significant contribution to the relatively unexplored field of gender in rock art, this volume contains a wealth of information for archaeologists, anthropologists, and art historians interested in past gender systems. Hays-Gilpin argues that art is at once a product of its physical and social environment and at the same time a tool of influence in shaping behavior and ideas within a society. Taking this stance, rock art is shown to be very often one of the strongest lines of evidence avaliable to scholars in understanding ritual practices, gender roles, and ideologicial constructs of prehistoric peoples. Subsequently issues of representation and the people who made these forms of art are also discussed."

The informative and engaging text is contributed by W. W. Newcomb, Jr., former director of the Texas Memorial Museum and author of The Indians of Texas. Those early Indians, at different times and places and in a variety of styles, carved and painted their art from Paint Rock in West Central Texas to the canyons of the Big Bend, from the Canadian River Valley in the Panhandle to the Hueco Tanks near El Paso. As the form for this art was varied, so too were the reasons for its execution. Much rock art was no doubt born of magical and religious beliefs, or served to illustrate myths, but some apparently commemorated actual events and some seems to have been only tallies or messages. Kirkland recorded it all with consummate skill, preserving for other generations, as he said he would, the often remarkable, always fascinating art of vanished people."

He drove a rental car from New York to Rhode Island to Georgia to Mississippi to Iowa to Minneapolis to Fargo to Seattle, and he chased death and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll all the way. Within the span of twenty-one days, Chuck had three relationships end\u2014one by choice, one by chance, and one by exhaustion. He snorted cocaine in a graveyard. He walked a half-mile through a bean field. A man in Dickinson, North Dakota, explained to him why we have fewer windmills than we used to. He listened to the KISS solo albums and the Rod Stewart box set. At one point, poisonous snakes became involved. The road is hard. From the Chelsea Hotel to the swampland where Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s plane went down to the site where Kurt Cobain blew his head off, Chuck explored every brand of rock star demise. He wanted to know why the greatest career move any musician can make is to stop breathing...and what this means for the rest of us."

        "abstract": "Countless writers and artists have spoken for a generation, but no one has done it quite like Chuck Klosterman. With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And don't even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. <br /><br />Whether deconstructing <i>Saved by the Bell</i> episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he'll make you laugh, and he'll drive you insane -- usually all at once. <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i> is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but -- really -- it's about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, \"In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever 'in and of itself.'\" Read to believe."

It says what most scientists and politicians are afraid to say about what research can and, perhaps more importantly, cannot deliver on topics ranging from sexuality, race and genetic modification to stem cells, cloning, modern medicine, fertility treatment, creationism and bioterrorism.<br /><br />Having worked at the heart of government science, at the most prestigious science publishing company in the world, and in one of the world's leading biology institutions the author has a unique view of the politics, culture and reach of science. He illustrates how we are facing dangerous times where political agendas and public misunderstanding are hobbling truly novel work and hence calls for wide reaching changes in science education, funding, publishing and promulgation.<br /><br />"

It is rare that an economist has the courage and aptitude to take a studied look at real world issues and to lay out the advantages and disadvantages of current policies. Coyle takes these potentially confusing and politically rife issues and makes them straightforward, thereby educating the reader in an entertaining and sophisticated manner. Coyle uses humour and irony to explain the issues. Who else could draw a link between Japanese teenage fashion and the country's long standing liquidity trap; or how sunspots can determine whether we will have a financial crisis on earth; or how pork belly futures depend on the weather and pigs' amorous intentions? Throughout the book, Diane Coyle highlights the fact that above all, economics is a social science, and one that affects us all."

The monologues in <i>Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll</i> form a composite picture of the complex, sometimes alarming state of American culture in the 1990s.<br /><br />One of America\u2019s premier performers and most innovative and provocative artists, Bogosian\u2019s plays and solo work include <i>suburbia</i> (Lincoln Center Theater, 1994; adapted to film by director Richard Linklater, 1996); <i>Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll</i>, <i>Pounding Nails in the Floor with My Forehead</i>; <i>Griller</i>; <i>Humpty Dumpty</i>; <i>1+1</i>; <i>Skunkweed</i>; <i>Wake Up and Smell the Coffee</i>; <i>Drinking in America</i>; <i>Notes from Underground</i> and <i>Talk Radio</i> (Pulitzer Prize finalist; New York Shakespeare Festival, 1987; Broadway, 2007; adapted to film by director Oliver Stone, 1988).

        "abstract": "There is an alternative to 12-step! You can reduce almost any type of addictive behavior -- from drinking to sex, eating, and the Internet -- with this practical and effective workbook. Treats addictive behaviors in general, not one at a time -- because if you\u2019re prone to addictions, you\u2019ve probably got more than one. Addictive behavior can result from the use of almost any substance, or involvement in almost any activity. The harm that results from the addictive behavior, and the individual's difficulty in controlling it, is what matters. Supported by scientific research, Dr. Horvath approaches addiction as a bad habit, not a disease. He emphasizes taking responsibility, without requiring an allegiance to a \"higher power,\" and teaches general principles of addictive behavior change, so readers can apply them as often as they need. Horvath teaches the consequences (and even possible benefits) of addictive behavior, alternative coping methods, choice, understanding and dealing with urges, building a new lifestyle, preventing relapse. Includes dozens of exercises, self-study questions, guidelines for individual change plans."

        "abstract": "Russell Simmons, the original and eternal hip-hop mogul, is one of the most innovative and influential figures in modern American business and culture. When no one outside of inner-city New York had even heard of hip-hop, Simmons saw the seeds of a global force that would change the way people talk, dress, listen to music, and choose the heroes they hang on their walls. Today, he oversees a sprawling, multimillion-dollar empire of culture-defining businesses in everything from music to fashion, advertising to film, and media to visual art. At the same time he\u2019s broadened his interests and influence and pushed hip-hop to new plateaus of power and relevance. <b>Life and Def</b> is a one-of-a-kind tale that interweaves the remarkable journey of Russell Simmons with the story of the culture he\u2019s transformed and been transformed by. <br /><br />In his own brash, compelling voice, Simmons chronicles his numerous business successes and occasional failures. He tells the story of the founding of the legendary Def Jam Records, whose roster stretches from original rap icons like L.L. Cool J, Public Enemy, and the Beastie Boys to today\u2019s top stars, including Jay-Z and DMX. He traces the launching of Def Comedy Jam, the long-running hit television series that introduced a new generation of black comedic stars to America, from Martin Lawrence and Bill Bellamy to Bernie Mac and Chris Rock. He spins hilarious tales of his adventures in Hollywood, where he\u2019s produced hit movies like Eddie Murphy\u2019s The Nutty Professor and worked with quirky geniuses like Abel Ferrara. He also tells the story of Phat Farm, the wildly successful pioneering urban clothing label whose origins lay in Russell\u2019s longtime fascination with fashion (and fashion models).<br /><br />Simmons\u2019s story is also one of personal transformation, from the driven man who in the heady days of early success indulged himself with drugs, sex, and world-class decadence to the husband and father he is today, a man who has found meaning in activism, philanthropy, and spiritual practice while never losing his passion for the social, political, artistic, and commercial potential of hip-hop.<br /><br />Through it all he relates telling anecdotes about the characters he\u2019s dealt with: models and gangsters, street poets and gurus, and major players like Donald Trump, Sean Combs, Jon Peters, and Tupac Shakur. Full of advice, opinions, and behind-the-scenes scoop, <b>Life and Def</b> is the story of the quintessential hip-hop life.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

From a 16-page newspaper about punk bands and violence to stores, a clothing line, VICE Films, VICE TV, VICE Records, viceland.com, etc., VICE has become much more than a way for three guys to get laid. It's become a lifestyle, a degrading and disgusting lifestyle of sex and drugs and rock and roll and death. This book is a collection of the irreverent, hilarious and downright scary gonzo journalism that brought three losers from the crack houses of Le Plateau to the deluxe apartments of Manhattan."

        "abstract": "Corporate Vices uncovers the real performance gap in modern corporations between good business practice that builds companies, and bad corporate habits that eventually bring them down. It builds a detailed picture of how wayward corporations often try too hard, think too little, and forget too much. And it offers a sharp contrast with companies, large and small, that are good businesses, and how they manage to stay that way.<br /><br /> Looking behind the headlines of spectacular corporate disasters, such as Enron and Marconi, as well as corporations that are under pressure and going nowhere, Corporate Vices identifies the common theme of badly run companies, that they fail to realise, or just forget, the importance of business basics, such as productivity, as they explore ever more sophisticated and expensive ways of satisfying other more immediate, like keeping cash profits high to satisfy shareholders - even at the expense of productivity. Corporate Vices explores the complex roots and the story of how corporations have allowed themselves to turn business logic on its head with such ease.<br /><br /> Corporate Vices puts an alternative way of running companies on the table in its many examples of good businesses. These are companies that manage to keep their eye on the ball, even at a price: not achieving corporate glory, turning down the latest technology, and opportunities to enter new markets.<br /><br /> Most of all, Corporate Vices makes it clear how to spot the difference, and then to fix it. It asks the questions, which everyone stuck in a bad company can't seem to answer, like, <br /> * Where did we start to go wrong?<br /> * What does the CEO think he's doing?<br /> * Why can't anyone make a decision any more?<br /> * Whose idea was this merger?"

She had already begun the week as a bride...and ended it as a murderess. She was sure no one would believe that she'd hit her elderly groom with a bed warmer and knocked him quite dead by accident. So she did the only thing she could - she ran. Yet now she was in no position to turn down a shocking proposition from the dangerously handsome Duke of Redmayne: that she become one man's wife and another man's mistress - <i>his</i> mistress. Could she play such a role? Could she live up to such a bargain? And once she had tasted the pleasures of Redmayne's bed, would she ever want anything else."

Pirsig's <i>Zen &amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> is a powerfully moving &amp; penetrating examination of how we live, a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation, an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father &amp; his young son. A story of love &amp; fear--of growth, discovery &amp; acceptance--that becomes a profound personal &amp; philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching &amp; transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence &amp; the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward."

        "abstract": "\"Pb-pb-b-b-b. Pb-pb-b-b-b.\" With these magic vocables, Ralph the mouse revs up a dream come true--his very own motorcycle. Living in a knothole in a hotel room, young Ralph has seen plenty of families come and go, some more generous with their crumbs than others. But when young Keith and his parents check in to the hotel, Ralph gets his first chance to check out. He has always fantasized about venturing beyond the second floor, maybe even outside. Curiosity overcomes caution, and Ralph must have a go at Keith's toy motorcycle. Soon, the headstrong mouse finds himself in a pickle, when all he wanted was to ride a motorcycle. Lucky for him, the boy understands how it is. When he discovers Ralph in his thwarted attempt to abscond with the toy bike, Keith generously encourages the rodent to ride. He even teaches him the simple trick of starting the motorcycle: \"You have to make a noise... pb-pb-b-b-b.\" The subsequent situations Ralph motors into require quick thinking and grownup-sized courage."

A combination of philosophical speculation and psychological tension, the book is a complex story of relationships, values, madness, and, eventually, enlightenment.<br /><br />Ron Di Santo and Tom Steele have spent years investigating the background and underlying symbolism of Pirsig\u2019s work. Together, and with the approval of Robert Pirsig, they have written a fascinating reference/companion to the original.<br /><br /><em>Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> serves as a metaphorical backpack of supplies for the reader\u2019s journey through the original work. With the background material, insights, and perspectives the authors provide, <em>Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> is destined to become required reading for new fans of the book as well as those who have returned to it over the years."

Each case study explores the design brief, the relationship with the client, the time frame, and the results."

The variety of styles and techniques covered the complete creative spectrum. <em>The Big Book of Logos</em> became one of the best-selling graphics books of all time, the first best resource to consult when devising a new logo.<br /><br />Soon after, came T<em>he New Big Book of Logos</em> featuring another 2,500 designs, and, after that, <em>The Big Book of Logos 3,</em> which is now available here, for the first time in an affordable paperback edition. Logo designers are always looking for sources of inspiration, wanting to see \"what's new\" and this book has it all. Every logo designer should have this on the shelf for frequent use, and the new paperback format (and pricing!) will ensure that <em>The Big Book of Logos 3</em> will take its place alongside the series' earlier volumes as an indispensable reference for every designer."

        "abstract": "With an Introduction and Notes by Dr T.C.B.Cook <br /><br />Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) is best known for War and Peace and Anna Karenina, commonly regarded as amongst the greatest novels ever written. He also, however, wrote many masterly short stories, and this volume contains four of the longest and best in distinguished translations that have stood the test of time. In the early story 'Family Happiness', Tolstoy explores courtship and marriage from the point of view of a young wife. In 'The Kreutzer Sonata' he gives us a terrifying study of marital breakdown, in 'The Devil' a powerful depiction of the power of sexual temptation, and, in perhaps the finest of all, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich', he portrays the long agony of a man gradually coming to terms with his own mortality.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ISBN 1840224533 <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18384.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich_and_Other_Stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>"

And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving, and human, figures in world literature."

        "abstract": "Tolstoy famously wrote, \u201cHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d To Tracy Farber, thirty-three, happily single, headed for tenure at a major university, and content to build a life around friends and work, this celebrated maxim is questionable at best. Because if Tolstoy is to be taken at his word, only unhappiness is interesting; happiness must be as placid and unmemorable as a daisy in a field of a thousand daisies.<br /><br />Having decided to reject the petty indignities of dating, Tracy focuses instead on her secret project: to determine whether happiness can be interesting, in literature and in life, or whether it can be -- must be -- a plant with thorns and gnarled roots. It's an unfashionable proposition, and a potential threat to her job security. But Tracy is her own best example of a happy and interesting life. Little does she know, however, that her best proof will come when she falls for George, who will challenge all of her old assumptions, as love proves to be even more complicated than she had imagined. Can this young feminist scholar, who posits that \"a woman's independence is a hothouse flower -- improbable, rare, requiring vigilance,\" find happiness in a way that fulfills both her head and her heart?<br /><br />Love may be the ultimate clich\u00e9, but in Rachel Kadish\u2019s hands, it is also a morally serious question, deserving of our sober attention as well as our delighted laughter."

        "abstract": "Banned in Russia, Tolstoy's <i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i> was deemed a threat to church and state. The culmination of a lifetime's thought, it espouses a commitment to Jesus's message of turning the other cheek. In a bold and original manner, Tolstoy shows his readers clearly why they must reject violence of any sort\u2014even that sanctioned by the state or the church\u2014and urges them to look within themselves to find the answers to questions of morality.<br />In 1894, one of the first English translations of this book found its way into the hands of a young Gandhi. Inspired by its message of nonresistance to evil, the Mahatma declared it a source of \"independent thinking, profound morality, and truthfulness.\" Much of this work's emotional and moral appeal lies in its emphasis on fair treatment of the poor and working class. Its view of Christianity, not as a mystic religion but as a workable philosophy originating from the words of a remarkable teacher, extends its appeal to secular and religious readers alike."

        "abstract": "\u201cThe more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death.\u201d Leo Tolstoy spoke these words, and they became Henry Stuart\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. <i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is the unforgettable novel based on the true story of Henry Stuart\u2019s life, which was reclaimed from his doctor\u2019s belief that he would not live another year.<br /><br />Henry responds to the news by slogging home barefoot in the rain. It\u2019s 1925. The place: Canyon County, Idaho. Henry is sixty-seven, a retired professor and a widower who has been told a warmer climate would make the end more tolerable. San Diego would be a good choice. <br /><br />Instead, Henry chose Fairhope, Alabama, a town with utopian ideals and a haven for strong-minded individualists. Upton Sinclair, Sherwood Anderson, and Clarence Darrow were among its inhabitants. Henry bought his own ten acres of piney woods outside Fairhope. Before dying, underscored by the writings of his beloved Tolstoy, Henry could begin to \u201cperfect the soul awarded him\u201d and rest in the faith that he, and all people, would succeed, \u201ceven if it took eons.\u201d Human existence, Henry believed, continues in a perfect circle unmarred by flaws of personality, irrespective of blood and possessions and rank, and separate from organized religion. In Alabama, until his final breath, he would chase these high ideas.<br /><br />But first, Henry had to answer up for leaving Idaho. Henry\u2019s dearest friend and intellectual sparring partner, Pastor Will Webb, and Henry\u2019s two adult sons, Thomas and Harvey, were baffled and angry that he would abandon them and move to the Deep South, living in a barn there while he built a round house of handmade concrete blocks. His new neighbors were perplexed by his eccentric behavior as well. On the coldest day of winter he was barefoot, a philosopher and poet with ideas and words to share with anyone who would listen. And, mysteriously, his \u201clast few months\u201d became years. He had gone looking for a place to learn lessons in dying, and, studiously advanced to claim a vigorous new life.<br /><br /><i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is a moving and irresistible story, a guidebook of the mind and spirit that lays hold of the heart. Henry Stuart points the way through life\u2019s puzzles for all of us, becoming in this timeless tale a character of such dimension that he seems more alive now than ever.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

        "abstract": "Hunters of Dune and the concluding volume, Sandworms of Dune, bring together the great story lines and beloved characters in Frank Herbert's classic Dune universe, ranging from the time of the Butlerian Jihad to the original Dune series and beyond. Based directly on Frank Herbert's final outline, which lay hidden in a safe-deposit box for a decade, these two volumes will finally answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been debating for two decades.At the end of Chapterhouse: Dune-Frank Herbert's final novel--a ship carrying the ghola of Duncan Idaho, Sheeana (a young woman who can control sandworms), and a crew of various refugees escapes into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from the monstrous Honored Matres, dark counterparts to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. The nearly invincible Honored Matres have swarmed into the known universe, driven from their home by a terrifying, mysterious Enemy. As designed by the creative genius of Frank Herbert, the primary story of Hunters and Sandworms is the exotic odyssey of Duncan's no-ship as it is forced to elude the diabolical traps set by the ferocious, unknown Enemy. To strengthen their forces, the fugitives have used genetic technology from Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, to revive key figures from Dune's past-including Paul Muad'Dib and his beloved Chani, Lady Jessica, Stilgar, Thufir Hawat, and even Dr. Wellington Yueh. Each of these characters will use their special talents to meet the challenges thrown at them.Failure is unthinkable--not only is their survival at stake, but they hold the fate of the entire human race in their hands."

What is the world\u2019s motor \u2014 and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. <br /><br />Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life \u2014 from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy \u2014 to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction \u2014 to the philosopher who becomes a pirate \u2014 to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph \u2014 to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad \u2014 to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. <br /><br /><b>You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.</b><br /><br />This is a mystery story, not about the murder \u2014 and rebirth \u2014 of man\u2019s spirit.

As fresh today as it was then, Rand's provocative novel presents one of the most challenging ideas in all of fiction--that man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress...<br /><br /><b>\"A writer of great power. She has a subtle and ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly, beautifully, bitterly...This is the only novel of ideas written by an American woman that I can recall.\"--<i>The New York Times</i></b>"

        "abstract": "<i>Anthem</i> has long been hailed as one of Ayn Rand's classic novels, and a clear predecessor to her later masterpieces, <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. In Anthem, Rand examines a frightening future in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. Equality 7-2521 lives in the dark ages of the future where all decisions are made by committee, all people live in collectives, and all traces of individualism have been wiped out. Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great \"we\" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--\"I.\""

This is the view of Ayn Rand, a view so radically opposed to prevailing attitudes that it constitutes a major philosophic revolution. In this series of essays, she presents her stand on the persecution of big business, the causes of war, the default of conservatism, and the evils of altruism. Here is a challenging new look at modern society by one of the most provocative intellectuals on the American scene.<br /> \u00a0<br /> This edition includes two articles by Ayn Rand that did not appear in the hardcover edition: \u201cThe Wreckage of the Consensus,\u201d which presents the Objectivists\u2019 views on Vietnam and the draft; and \u201cRequiem for Man,\u201d an answer to the Papal encyclical <i>Progresso Populorum.</i>"

        "abstract": "This collection of essays was the last work planned by <b>Ayn Rand</b> before her death in 1982. In it, she summarizes her view of philosophy and deals with a broad spectrum of topics. According to Ayn Rand, the choice we make is not whether to have a philosophy, but which one to have: rational, conscious, and therefore practical; or contradictory, unidentified, and ultimately lethal. Written with all the clarity and eloquence that have placed Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy in the mainstream of American thought, these essays range over such basic issues as education, morality, censorship, and inflation to prove that philosophy is the fundamental force in all our lives."

In <i>Sailing for Dummies, Second Edition</i>, two U.S. sailing champions show you how to:<br /><br /><br />Find and choose a sailing school Use life jackets correctly Tie ten nautical knots Handle sailing emergencies (such as capsizing and rescuing a man overboard) Launch your boat from a trailer, ramp, or beach Get your boat from point A to point B (and back again) Predict and respond to water and wind conditions Read charts, plot your course, use a compass, and find your position at sea <i>Sailing for Dummies</i> shows you that getting out on the water is easier than you think. The authors keep the sailor-speak to a minimum where possible, but give you a grasp of the terminology you need to safely and effectively communicate with your crew. A textbook, user's manual, and reference all in one, this book takes the intimidation out of sailing and gives you the skills and confidence you need to get your feet wet and become the sailing pro you've always wanted to be.

        "abstract": "A gripping intellectual adventure story, Sailing from Byzantium sweeps you from the deserts of Arabia to the dark forests of northern Russia, from the colorful towns of Renaissance Italy to the final moments of a millennial city under siege.... <br />Byzantium: the successor of Greece and Rome, this magnificent empire bridged the ancient and modern worlds for more than a thousand years. Without Byzantium, the works of Homer and Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle, Sophocles and Aeschylus, would never have survived. Yet very few of us have any idea of the enormous debt we owe them. <br />The story of Byzantium is a real-life adventure of electrifying ideas, high drama, colorful characters, and inspiring feats of daring. In Sailing from Byzantium, Colin Wells tells of the missionaries, mystics, philosophers, and artists who against great odds and often at peril of their own lives spread Greek ideas to the Italians, the Arabs, and the Slavs. <br />Their heroic efforts inspired the Renaissance, the golden age of Islamic learning, and Russian Orthodox Christianity, which came complete with a new alphabet, architecture, and one of the world's greatest artistic traditions. <br />The story's central reference point is an arcane squabble called the Hesychast controversy that pitted humanist scholars led by the brilliant, acerbic intellectual Barlaam against the powerful monks of Mount Athos led by the stern Gregory Palamas, who denounced \"pagan\" rationalism in favor of Christian mysticism. <br />Within a few decades, the light of Byzantium would be extinguished forever by the invading Turks, but not before the humanists found a safe haven for Greek literature. The controversy of rationalism versus faith would continue to be argued by some of history's greatest minds. <br />Fast-paced, compulsively readable, and filled with fascinating insights, Sailing from Byzantium is one of the great historical dramas-the gripping story of how the flame of civilization was saved and passed on."

These poems show Collins at his best, performing the kinds of distinctive poetic maneuvers that have delighted and fascinated so many readers. They may begin in curiosity and end in grief; they may start with irony and end with lyric transformation; they may, and often do, begin with the everyday and end in the infinite. Possessed of a unique voice that is at once plain and melodic, Billy Collins has managed to enrich American poetry while greatly widening the circle of its audience."

It follows the techniques perfected at the world-famous Annapolis Sailing School, where thousands of people just like you have learned to take tiller in hand and harness the wind. You'll learn your way around a boat--what its parts are called, what they do, and how to use them to ride the wind wherever you want to go. Read this book, spend some time on a boat, and practice your new skills, and pretty soon you'll \"be\" a sailor, one of a select group of people who think there's nothing finer than hiking out to windward in a close-hauled dinghy--racing against friends or a neighboring sailing club, or alone and just for the fun of it."

And for nearly as long, stories about the sea have entertained, intrigued, and inspired readers. The Greatest Sailing Stories Ever Told brings together some of the most compelling writing of the millennium. Here is Peter Goss's wrenching narrative of incredible courage in the world's most desolate ocean; Ernest Shackleton's understated and awesome account of one of the most daring small-boat journeys ever taken, where failure meant certain death for his long-suffering crew. But sailing is much more than headlong dashes into roaring seas. You'll also find William F. Buckley Jr. on idyllic cruising; James Thurber on the arcane and often impenetrable language of sailors; the legendary Joshua Slocum on sailing alone around the world. The Greatest Sailing Stories Ever Told is a treasure trove: tears, adrenaline, laughter, and adventure abound. With contributions from: - James Thurber -William F. Buckley Jr. - Ann Davison - Sterling Hayden - Ernest Shackleton - Tristan Jones - Samuel Eliot Morrison - Joshua Slocum - E. B. White - C. S. Forester - Cleveland Amory - Weston Martyr - Peter Goss - David Kasanof"

Buddy Melges, one of the world's best-known sailors, has at last set down his highly original thoughts on how to sail <i>well</i>. He covers the full range of sailing experience, from the general to the specific, the basic to the highly sophisticated. Melges's message is delivered in a bright, uncluttered manner by way of applications from his own sailing experience and through step-by-step instructions on everything from basic boat handling to expert on-the-course tactics and maneuvers. The book is profusely illustrated by the noted sailing artist Ted Brennan, and each drawing is accompanied by a cogent, in-depth explanatory caption."

In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material\u2014the story of a superbly gifted \"natural\" at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era\u2014and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin's comment still holds true: \"Malamud has done something which\u2014now that he has done it!\u2014looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives. He has really raised the whole passion and craziness and fanaticism of baseball as a popular spectacle to its ordained place in mythology.\""

        "abstract": "2ndsight is the sequel to The End of Print, the first monograph on David Carson's work. While The End of Print showed the world Carson's radical new approach, his rejection of the traditional 'rules' of communication, 2ndsight examines the creative process behind the work, and considers the broader implications of his intuitive approach to graphic design. Intuition is central to the book's thesis, and its meaning and influence is explored both in Lewis Blackwell's writing and in the evocative texts by leading designers and thinkers interspersed throughout the book. As well as presenting Carson's commercial work - his latest ideas in advertising, magazine and book design, web sites, film and video - 2ndsight examines work inspired by exhibitions, talks and workshops. The student workshops Carson conducts in design colleges around the world throw particular light on his creative process. The workings of these sessions are examined: their chief aim being not to teach computer skills or encourage participants to mimic the master, but to help them find their own voice. Finally, a conversation between Blackwell and Carson probes Carson's working methods - his collage technique of using two or more files at once on screen; of working in black and white; of moving to and from the computer, printing out each stage of a design before developing it further; his experimentation with the balance of type and image. Above all, his respect for intuition and his conviction that it is the key to truly individual graphic expression."

        "abstract": "Designer and author David Carson pronounced the \"End of Print\" in response to the virtual world's ever-increasing influence on design. And if \"Ortlos: Architecture of the Networks\" is any indication, it seems that the group will soon pronounce the \"End of Architecture\" (as we know it). Ortlos--which means \"placeless\" in German--is a virtual office (or platform) that deals with architectural topics, urban planning issues and interface design. Its members include a global network of architects, web designers, media theorists, net artists and IT specialists, all of whom are experts in their various fields and professions, and all of whom can collaborate on online projects that are either of interest to them, or specific to their locales. \"Ortlos\" also describes the virtual office's basic working method: not being dependent on a specific physical space to work, but located instead in networks and anywhere where an Internet connection is provided. The firm aims to generate advanced instruments for architectural and urban design, a sort of platform, a creative pool supported with information and databases: It is a virtual office that never sleeps. Designed and written by the firm's \"partners,\" \"Architecture of the Networks\" documents Ortlos' projects from 2000 to 2003. Each of the 12 projects shown and explained here by Ortlos incorporates various approaches to the fields of architecture, urban planning, media theory, product design, installation art and interface design. This new and fresh way of addressing contemporary architecture also includes a research project about network collaborations, and Carson's interpretation of Ortlos' architectural work through the specific language of graphic design."

        "abstract": "In what is perhaps her richest and most deeply searching novel, Anne Tyler gives us a story about what it is to be an American, and about Maryam Yazdan, who after thirty-five years in this country must finally come to terms with her \u201coutsiderness.\u201d<br /><br />Two families, who would otherwise never have come together, meet by chance at the Baltimore airport\u2014the Donaldsons, a very American couple, and the Yazdans, Maryam\u2019s fully assimilated son and his attractive Iranian American wife. Each couple is awaiting the arrival of an adopted infant daughter from Korea. After the babies from distant Asia are delivered, Bitsy Donaldson impulsively invites the Yazdans to celebrate with an \u201carrival party,\u201d an event that is repeated every year as the two families become more deeply intertwined.<br /><br />Even independent-minded Maryam is drawn in. But only up to a point. When she finds herself being courted by one of the Donaldson clan, a good-hearted man of her vintage, recently widowed and still recovering from his wife\u2019s death, suddenly all the values she cherishes\u2014her traditions, her privacy, her otherness\u2014are threatened. Somehow this big American takes up so much space that the orderly boundaries of her life feel invaded.<br /><br />A luminous novel brimming with subtle, funny, and tender observations that cast a penetrating light on the American way as seen from two perspectives, those who are born here and those who are still struggling to fit in."

        "abstract": "Now in its sixth edition, Modern Latin America is a lively interpretive history and the leading text in the field. Thoroughly updated and revised, the book includes a new chapter on the history of Colombia from the wars of independence to the violent conflicts of the present day. It also examines such topics as: <br /> * the impact of 9/11 on U.S.-Latin American relations <br /> * globalization <br /> * drug trafficking <br /> * women's roles in society and politics <br /> * the fragility and uncertainty of democracy in Latin America <br /> The book features sociocultural sections and boxes in nearly every chapter, covering such diverse areas as the psychology of exile, Santeria in Cuba, baseball in the Dominican Republic, and the popularity of Latin music in the U.S. All political and economic information has been updated. As in earlier editions, the authors use an in-depth case study approach that guides readers through the major countries of Latin America, highlighting central themes including European-New World interaction, racial mixtures, military takeovers, and United States intervention in the area. With an insightful look into the future, Modern Latin America, Sixth Edition, will continue to be an exceptional text for undergraduate courses on contemporary Latin American history, society, and politics.\""

Lindbergh, heroic aviator and rabid isolationist, is elected President. Shortly thereafter, he negotiates a cordial \"understanding\" with Adolf Hitler, while the new government embarks on a program of folksy anti-Semitism.<br /><br />For one boy growing up in Newark, Lindbergh's election is the first in a series of ruptures that threatens to destroy his small, safe corner of America - and with it, his mother, his father, and his older brother.<br />(back cover)"

Addressing these pressing concerns are contributors Dr. David Satcher, former U.S. surgeon general; Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; Angela Glover Blackwell, founder of the research think tank PolicyLink; and Cornell West, professor of Religion at Princeton University. Each chapter outlines one key issue and provides a list of resources, suggestions for action, and a checklist for what concerned citizens can do to keep their communities progressing socially, politically, and economically. Though the African American community faces devastating social disparities\u2014in which more than 8 million people live in poverty\u2014this celebration of possibility, hope, and strength will help leaders and citizens keep Black America moving forward."

        "abstract": "Classic analysis of America's unique political character, quoted heavily by politicians and perennially popping up on history professors' reading lists. The book's enduring appeal lies in the eloquent, prophetic voice of Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), a French aristocrat who visited the United States in 1831. A thoughtful young man in a still-young country, he succeeded in penning this penetrating study of America's people, culture, history, geography, politics, legal system, and economy. Tocqueville asserts, I confess that in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress."

        "abstract": "Swiss graphic design and \u201cthe Swiss Style\u201d are crucial elements in the history of modernism. During the 1920s and \u201930s, skills traditionally associated with Swiss industry, particularly pharmaceuticals and mechanical engineering, were matched by those of the country\u2019s graphic designers, who produced their advertising and technical literature. These pioneering graphic artists saw design as part of industrial production and searched for anonymous, objective visual communication. They chose photographic images rather than illustration, and typefaces that were industrial-looking rather than those designed for books.Written by noted design authority Richard Hollis, this lavishly illustrated volume looks at the uniquely clear graphic language developed by such Swiss designers as Theo Ballmer, Max Bill, Adrian Frutiger, Karl Gerstner,\u00a0Armin Hoffman, Ernst Keller, Herbert Matter, Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann, and Jan Tschichold. The style of these artists received worldwide admiration for its formal discipline: images and text were organized by geometrical grids. Adopted internationally, the grid and sans serif typefaces such as Helvetica became the classic emblems of Swiss graphic design.Showcasing design work across a range of media, including posters, magazines, exhibition displays, brochures, advertisements, books, and film, this essential book shows how many of the Swiss designers\u2019 modernist elements remain an indispensable part of today\u2019s graphic language."

Influenced by the famous \"Swiss School\" of the 1950s and 60s, young Swiss designers today still hold concept and structure as functional beliefs, allowing artistic freedom in counterbalance to the service aspects of design. <p>Beautifully designed by the editors, Benzin is itself a statement on these theoretical questions. It includes detailed portrayals of twelve selected studios and images from 36 other designers making it a great sourcebook for anyone interested in graphic design today.<br /><br />Edited by Michel Fries &amp; Thomas Bruggisser.

David P. Billington, who has written widely on these engineers, argues that it is important to consider them as artists, for aesthetics played a major role in their design philosophy. He explains that their shared approach to design was developed while they attended the Federal Technological Institute in Zurich: Maillart and Amman studied with Ritter there, and Isler and Menn studied under Lardy. Billington focuses on the engineers' artistic approach to bridge design and construction, and he discusses their impressive individual contributions to structural engineering. Generously illustrated, this book features many newly commissioned photographs, including images of important new structures such as the Charles River Bridge in Boston, completed by Menn in 2002."

Erotic. As hypnotizing as it is disturbing\u201d (Los Angeles Times).<br /><br />On the eve of his ninetieth birthday, our unnamed protagonist\u2013an undistinguished journalist and lifelong bachelor\u2013decides to give himself \u201cthe gift of a night of wild love with an adolescent virgin.\u201d<br /><br />The girl, whom an old madam procures for him, is splendidly young, with the silent power of a sleeping beauty. The night of love blossoms into a transforming year. It is a year in which he relives, in a rush of memories, his lifetime of (paid-for) sexual adventures and experiences a revelation that brings him to the edge of dying\u2013not of old age, but, at long last, of uncorrupted love. <br /><br />Memories of My Melancholy Whores is a brilliant gem by the master storyteller."

Pero la sorpresa salt\u00f3 al destapar la tercera hornacina del altar mayor: se desparram\u00f3 una cabellera de color cobre, de veintid\u00f3s metros y once cent\u00edmetros de largo, perteneciente a una ni\u00f1a. En la l\u00e1pida apenas se le\u00eda el nombre: Sierva Mar\u00eda de Todos los \u00c1ngeles. <br />\u00a0<br />Cuenta el propio Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: \"Mi abuela me contaba de ni\u00f1o la leyenda de una marquesita de doce a\u00f1os cuya cabellera le arrastraba como una cola de novia, que hab\u00eda muerto del mal de rabia por el mordisco de un perro, y era venerada en los pueblos del Caribe por sus muchos milagros. La idea de que esa tumba pudiera ser la suya fue mi noticia de aquel d\u00eda, y el origen de este libro\"."

The result is as spectacular as his finest fiction. <br /><br />Here is Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s shimmering evocation of his childhood home of Aracataca, the basis of the fictional Macondo. Here are the members of his ebulliently eccentric family. Here are the forces that turned him into a writer.

        "abstract": "Science has produced the vast information explosion that barrages us daily with data both trivial and profound. Though people seem eager to acquire more and more information, few understand what to do with it or how to integrate it into a coherent worldview. Paradoxically, as information has increased, knowledge has declined.<br />This book is designed to provide a thorough grounding in science literacy for the general lay reader. Acclaimed science writer and chemistry professor Keith J. Laidler reviews the major contributions of the different branches of science - including biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and geology - and shows how they all lead to a unified conception of our place in the universe. He further asserts that by lifting the great veil of mystery through science, we can more fully appreciate the beauty of the universe. Although much still remains to be discovered, Laidler stresses that evidence from every field of science supports a consensus view, an elegantly logical and self-consistent picture of the formation and development of the universe and of life within it.<br />Even more important than understanding the basic features of this scientific worldview is knowing the method by which science arrives at its conclusions. He points out that this approach to ascertaining the truth is used by judges in courts of law and by scholars in academic fields of the humanities, as well as by scientists. By learning to weigh sound evidence in an objective and unbiased fashion, we can selectively judge the information that surrounds us and integrate it into a scientific understanding, while still retaining our sense of wonder.<br />This elegantly written and lucid explanation of science in contemporary life will not only spark an interest into the wonders of many fascinating scientific disciplines but will stimulate readers to think more critically and scientifically."

In the twentieth century, she grew to become one of the most famous teachers in Thailand--male or female--all the more remarkable because, rarer still, she was not a monastic but a layperson. Her relentless honesty, along with her encouraging voice, is one reason so many contemporary Buddhist teachers recall Upasika Kee so fondly, and so often. With this book, readers seeking something reminiscent of the classic <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> can receive instruction on meditation practice as they become acquainted with the legacy of a renowned Buddhist figure. <i>Pure and Simple</i>, the first widely-available collection of her writings, will be gratefully received not only by those who knew Upasika Kee, but by anyone who encounters her for the first time in its pages."

When the Buddha was asked to sum up his teaching in a single word, he said, \"Awareness.\" The Buddha taught how to see directly into the nature of experience. His observations and insights are plain, practical, and down-to-earth, and they deal exclusively with the present. In Buddhism Plain and Simple, Steve Hagen presents these uncluttered, original teachings in everyday, accessible language unencumbered by religious ritual, tradition, or belief."

Drifting from one job to another, he stalked the streets as a troubled youth, barely surviving while all of his peers were either dead or in jail, until he found himself on the steps of the Shaolin Temple.<br /><br />Originating more than 1,500 years ago in ancient China, the Shaolin monks were simple farmers and worshippers of Buddhism who learned to protect themselves from the constant danger of bandits and overlords with a kind of \"meditation in motion,\" a nonlethal form of self-defense that didn't violate their vows of peace. As their legend grew, they became known as the Shaolin Fighting Monks, revered across the land for their spiritual dedication, enlightened message, and amazing fighting skills.<br /><br />DeMasco entered the Shaolin Temple to battle the demons of his past. But he got more than he bargained for. Besides learning how to wield weapons and take on multiple attackers at once, he discovered an ancient philosophy that helped melt away preconceived notions of the world, and gave him a powerful platform on which to live and grow. In <em>The Shaolin Way</em>, he adapts these teachings for the modern world, singling out ten secrets of survival that can help anyone live a more fulfilled life."

It includes some very cheap places and some potentially very expensive establishments, but the rule for inclusion is that it must be possible to eat at every restaurant for under 35 pounds a head. Restaurants are grouped by area and should suit all budgets and tastes - cuisines include French, Indian, Chinese, British, Caribbean, Polish and Ethiopian. The book contains three indexes: A-Z by name, cuisine type and mood to help readers make the right decision."

The book describes forty walks, all within an hour's train journey of the capital, and all accompanied by detailed route maps and evocative descriptions of sights encountered en route -- from Iron Age hill forts to stately homes -- as well as highlighting the best cafes and pubs to break your journey."

        "abstract": "One of the most dependable series available, Lonely Planet's guidebooks are packed with essential information and accurate maps and are written with enough character that they are also good reading for armchair travelers. The series is now popular with travelers of all sorts, although backpackers and adventure travelers have long relied on Lonely Planet's guides because of the wide range of destinations offered. Whether you want to relax on the beaches of Thailand, roam the Australian outback, or explore the deserts of Iran, Lonely Planet has a practical, thorough guidebook for your destination. For dangerous or less-traveled regions, we highly recommend Lonely Planet's guides because they provide crucial information in an easy-to-use format, making it possible for travelers to handle the difficulties of language, customs, and transportation. In countries with unfamiliar alphabets, the guides include the names of cities and sights in both English and native characters, and glossaries are provided to help travelers with menus. The series offers lodging and restaurant options for all budgets, but the main focus is on getting a good deal for your money. With good writing, a wealth of valuable information, and beautiful color photo sections, Lonely Planet's guides are hard to beat.<i>(Julie Carr)</i>"

Explore its secrets with a detailed program that includes ten complete lessons, each concentrating on a particular part of the body.

Each technique is clearly explained and its benefits--from improved flexibility to increased vitality--detailed.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\"All of the techniques are shown in sharp color photographs that are pleasing to the eye.

        "abstract": "Three Nights in August captures the strategic and emotional complexities of baseball's quintessential form, the three-game series. As the St. Louis Cardinals battle their archrival Chicago Cubs, we watch from the dugout through the eyes of legendary manager Tony La Russa, considered by many to be the shrewdest mind in the game today. In his twenty-seven years of managing, La Russa has been named Manager of the Year a record-making five times and now stands as the third-winningest baseball manager of all time. A great leader, he's built his success on the conviction that ball games are won not only by the numbers but also by the hearts and minds of those who play.<br /><br />Drawing on unprecedented access to a major league manager and his team, Buzz Bissinger brings a revelatory intimacy to baseball and offers some surprising observations. Bissinger also furthers the debate on major league managerial style and strategy in his provocative new afterword."

        "abstract": "Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\"<br /><br />All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties."

Cet auteur descendant des <i>cyberpunks</i> cultive une \u00e9criture jubilatoire et foisonnante qui fait de ses \u0153uvres des bijoux d'un nouveau genre. <p>Apr\u00e8s les aventures d'un livreur de pizzas dans <i>Le Samoura\u00ef virtuel</i>, Stephenson s'attelle \u00e0 l'histoire de trois personnages : L.P. Waterhouse, d\u00e9crypteur de g\u00e9nie pendant la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale, de son petit-fils Randy, informaticien dou\u00e9 qui souhaite cr\u00e9er un paradis informatique en Asie et de Bobby Shaftoe, marine \u00e9m\u00e9rite en poste pendant la guerre du Pacifique. Ces trois destins crois\u00e9s, \u00e9loign\u00e9s autant dans le temps que dans l'\u00e9chelle sociale, semblent pourtant converger, dans ce premier volume, vers un \u00e9trange tr\u00e9sor de guerre japonais englouti dans le pacifique. Avec comme th\u00e8me central l'information et la d\u00e9sinformation en temps de guerre militaire ou \u00e9conomique, ce livre est un v\u00e9ritable pont entre les genres : romans de guerre, d'espionnage et de SF. <i>--Laurent Schneitter</i></p>"

        "abstract": "In the year 1689, a cabal of Barbary galley slaves -- including one Jack Shaftoe, aka King of the Vagabonds, aka Half-Cocked Jack -- devises a daring plan to win freedom and fortune. A great adventure ensues -- a perilous race for an enormous prize of silver ... nay, gold ... nay, legendary gold.<br /><br />In Europe, the exquisite and resourceful Eliza, Countess de la Zeur, is stripped of her immense personal fortune by France's most dashing privateer. Penniless and at risk from those who desire either her or her head (or both), she is caught up in a web of international intrigue, even as she desperately seeks the return of her most precious possession.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Newton and Leibniz continue to propound their grand theories as their infamous rivalry intensifies, stubborn alchemy does battle with the natural sciences, dastardly plots are set in motion ... and Daniel Waterhouse seeks passage to the Massachusetts colony in hopes of escaping the madness into which his world has descended.<br /><br />This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more."

        "abstract": "<b>From his triumphant debut with <i>Snow Crash</i> to the stunning success of his latest novel, <i>Quicksilver, </i> Neal Stephenson has quickly become the voice of a generation. In this now-classic political thriller, he and fellow author J. Frederick George tell a savagely witty, chillingly topical tale set in the tense moments of the Gulf War. </b><br /><br />When a foreign exchange student is found murdered at an Iowa University, Deputy Sheriff Clyde Banks finds that his investigation extends far beyond the small college town--all the way to the Middle East. Shady events at the school reveal that a powerful department is using federal grant money for highly dubious research. And what it's producing is a very nasty bug.<br /><br />Navigating a plot that leads from his own backyard to Washington, D.C., to the Gulf, where his Army Reservist wife has been called to duty, Banks realizes he may be the only person who can stop the wholesale slaughtering of thousands of Americans. It's a lesson in foreign policy he'll never forget."

Back to The Big U, that is, a hilarious send-up of American college life starring after years out of print, <em>The Big U</em> is required reading for anyone interested in the early work of this singular writer."

In this now-classic thriller, he and fellow author J. Frederick George tell a shocking tale with an all-too plausible premise. <br /><br />There's no way William A. Cozzano can lose the upcoming presidential election. He's a likable midwestern governor with one insidious advantage - an advantage provided by a shadowy group of backers. A biochip implanted in his head hardwires him to a computerized polling system. The mood of the electorate is channeled directly into his brain. Forget issues. Forget policy. Cozzano is more than the perfect candidate. He's a special effect. <br /><br /><br /><br />\"Complex, entertaining, frequently funny.\" - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br /><br /><br /><br />\"Qualifies as the sleeper of the year, the rare kind of science-fiction thriller that evokes genuine laughter while simultaneously keeping the level of suspense cranked to the max.\" - <i> San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br /><br /><br />\"<i>Manchurian Candidate</i> for the computer age.\" - <i>Seattle Weekly<br /></i>"

        "abstract": "Poker has taken America by storm. But it's not just any form of poker that has people across the country so excited \u2013 it's no-limit hold 'em \u2013 the main event game. And now \u2013 thanks to televised tournaments \u2013 tens of thousands of new players are eager to claim their share of poker glory.<br />In the first volume of this series, <i>Harrington on Hold \u2018em: Volume I: Strategic Play</i>, Dan Harrington explained how to play in the early phases of tournaments, when most players at the table have plenty of chips, and the blinds and antes are small. This book, <i>Harrington on Hold \u2018em: Volume II: The Endgame</i> shows you how to play in the later phases of a tournament, when the field has been cut down, the blinds and antes are growing, and the big prize money is within sight. Harrington shows you how to make moves, handle tricky inflection point plays, and maneuver when the tournament is down to its last few players and the end is in sight. He\u2019s also included a whole chapter on head-up play, whose strategies up to now have been a closely-guarded secret of the game\u2019s top masters.<br />Dan Harrington won the gold bracelet and the World Champion title at the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold 'Em Championship at the 1995 World Series of Poker. And he was the only player to make it to the final table in 2003 (field of 839) and 2004 (field of 2,576) \u2013 considered by cognoscenti to be the greatest accomplishment in WSOP history. In Harrington on Hold 'em, Harrington and 2-time World Backgammon Champion Bill Robertie have written the definitive book on no-limit hold 'em for players who want to win \u2013 and win big."

New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, as Donald Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating book, which has garnered acclaim everywhere from <i>Scientific American</i> to <i>The New Yorker</i>.<i>Emotional Design</i> articulates the profound influence of the feelings that objects evoke, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches, to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow.Norman draws on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights to present a bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world. <i>Emotional Design</i> will appeal not only to designers and manufacturers but also to managers, psychologists, and general readers who love to think about their stuff."

        "abstract": "Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure our which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this fascinating, ingenious\u2014even liberating\u2014book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology.The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The book presents examples aplenty\u2014among them, the VCR, computer, and office telephone, all models of how not to design for people.But good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. But the designer must care.The author is a world-famous psychologist and pioneer in the application of cognitive science. His aim is to raise the consciousness of both consumers and designers to the delights of products that are easy to use and understand."

While a subject such as archaeology, by its very nature, takes objects into account, other disciplines, such as psychology, emphasize internal mental structures and other non-material issues. This book brings together a team of contributors from across the social sciences who have been taking 'things' more seriously to examine how people relate to objects. The contributors focus on every day objects and how these objects enter into our activities over the course of time. Using a combination of different theoretical approaches, including actor network theory, ecological psychology, cognitive linguistics and science and technology studies, the book argues against the standard notion of objects and their properties as inert and meaningless and argues for the need to understand the relations between people and objects in terms of process and change."

Has the quest for 'the real thing' become so important because the high tech world of total virtuality threatens to engulf us?<br /><br />This pioneering book bridges design theory and anthropology to offer a new and challenging way of understanding the changing meanings of contemporary human-object relations. The act of consumption is only the starting point in objects' 'lives'. Thereafter they are transformed and invested with new meanings that reflect and assert who we are. Defining design as 'things with attitude' differentiates the highly visible fashionable object from ordinary artefacts that are taken for granted. Through case studies ranging from reproduction furniture to fashion and textiles to 'clutter', the author traces the connection between objects and authenticity, ephemerality and self-identity. But beyond this, she shows the materiality of the everyday in terms of space, time and the body and suggests a transition with the passing of time from embodiment to disembodiment.<br /><br />Shortlisted for the Design History Society Scholarship Prize 2001-2002"

        "abstract": "Alex Jones was an on-fire Penecostal minister in Detroit Who was a completely dedicated shepherd of his flock. He greatly loved his people and they loved him. In seeking to give his flock the most genuine experience of the early Church prayer and worship services, he carefully read Scripture, the Fathers of the Church and writings of the early saints. The more he read, the more Alex came to the startling conclusion that the present day Catholic Church - and the Holy Mass - is the same exact worship service from the very early Church. Alex began to share his findings with his parish, and eventually Alex, and most of his parish, joined the Catholic Church. This is his incredible story of a black Penecostal minister's challenging and dramatic spiritual jounrey, and the flock that followed him. Today he preaches with his usual passion about Christ - as a Catholic deacon! This book tells the story of Alex's life from his chidhood all the way to his conversion to Catholicism in 2001. It simultaneously tells the story of his wife, Donna, and her spiritual journey as well, which shows how they were not always on the same path during Alex's preparation for entering the Catholic Church. Each had to be personally, deeply convinced that this momentous, life-changing and career-changing spiritual decision was God's will for them."

        "abstract": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a powerful way to enrich the presentation of HTML-based web pages, allowing web authors to give their pages a more sophisticated look and more structure. CSS's compact file size helps web pages load quickly, and by allowing changes made in one place to be applied across the entire document, CSS can save hours of tedious changing and updating.But to leverage the full power of CSS, web authors first have to sift through CSS theory to find practical solutions that resolve real-world problems. Web authors can waste hours and earn ulcers trying to find answers to those all-too-common dilemmas that crop up with each project. The \"CSS Cookbook\" cuts straight through the theory to provide hundreds of useful examples and CSS code recipes that web authors can use immediately to format their web pages.The time saved by a single one of these recipes will make its cover price money well-spent. But the \"CSS Cookbook\" provides more than quick code solutions to pressing problems. The explanation that accompanies each recipe enables readers to customize the formatting for their specific purposes, and shows why the solution works, so you can adapt these techniques to other situations. Recipes range from the basics that every web author needs to code concoctions that will take your web pages to new levels.Reflecting CSS2, the latest specification, and including topics that range from basic web typography and page layout to techniques for formatting lists, forms, and tables, it is easy to see why the \"CSS Cookbook\" is regarded as an excellent companion to \"Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide\" and a must-have resource for any web author who has even considered using CSS."

Within this publication, the investors describe the paths they took that resulted in the creation of four separate, self-sustaining real estate empires. Self-sustaining means that the companies they started would continue to flourish without the day-to-day input of the founder. To fulfill such a qualification, the founder must have built a company consisting of a group of independent real estate entrepreneurs who are capable of managing and growing the business to the next level of success. The investors contributing to this book have achieved that goal."

With more than two million copies sold around the world, <em>The Alchemist</em> has established itself as a modern classic, universally admired.<br /><br />Paulo Coelho\u2019s masterpiece tells the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found.<br /><br />The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life\u2019s path, and, above all, following our dreams."

        "abstract": "In an alchemical ritual gone wrong, Edward Elric lost his arm and his leg, and his brother Alphonse became nothing but a soul in a suit of armor. Equipped with mechanical \"auto-mail\" limbs, Edward becomes a state alchemist, seeking the one thing that can restore his and his brother's bodies...the legendary Philosopher's Stone.<br /><br />The raid on the Devil's Nest becomes a slaughter, as government troops - led by the Fuhrer President himself, King Bradley - exterminate the half-human forces of the Homunculus Greed. But will Ed and Al survive the battle unchanged? As Greed is sent to meet his maker, foreign travelers arrive in Amestris, having crossed the great desert from the eastern country of Xing. Their names are Mei and Ling, and they've come for the Philosopher's Stone...and a secret even the Elric brothers never imagined..."

When two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, dabbled in this power to grant their dearest wish, one of them lost an arm and a leg...and the other became nothing but a soul locked into a body of living steel. Now Edward is an agent of the government, a slave of the military-alchemical complex, using his unique powers to obey orders...even to kill. Except his powers aren't unique. The world has been ravaged by the abuse of alchemy. And in pursuit of the ultimate alchemical treasure, the Philosopher's Stone, their enemies are even more ruthless than they are..."

Equipped with mechanical \"auto-mail\" limbs, Edward becomes a state alchemist, seeking the one thing that can restore his brother and himself... the legendary Philosopher's Stone.<br /><br />There are many types of alchemy in the world. Edward's commanding officer, \"Flame Alchemist\" Roy Mustang, can control fire. Shou Tucker, the \"Sewing-Life Alchemist,\" specializes in the most difficult alchemy of all...biological transmutation, the ability to alter the tissue of living things. But no matter what their power, alchemists are still human. And when a mysterious killer begins stalking state alchemists, no one can escape his vengeance..."

        "abstract": "With his trademark elegance and intelligence Robert Harris recreates a world on the brink of disaster.<br /><br />All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire's richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world's largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.<br /><br />But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line\u2014somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.<br /><br />Attilius\u2014decent, practical, and incorruptible\u2014promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work\u2014both natural and man-made\u2014threatening to destroy him.<br /><br />With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster."

It investigates public life, religious life, the economy, and the private arena. A special section is devoted to the eruption of 79 AD, described based on the most recent discoveries, and another section takes a look at Oplontis, the most celebrated villa in the suburbs of Pompeii - and legendarily owned by Poppea Sabina, Nero's second wife. An updated bibliography and a chronological outline conclude this journey back in time.This book was done with the collaboration of the Archaeological Superintendency of Pompeii and the Superintendency\u00a0for Archaeological Heritage of Naples and Caserta."

In addition to the destruction of Pompeii and the rediscovery of the ruins nearly 1,700 years later, the book shows what daily life was like in this prosperous Roman town in the year 79 A.D."

This provides her with an intimate, upstairs/downstairs perspective on household life in ancient times. At first she does menial work, but she improves her situation by telling stories and making prophecies. As her influence grows, she wins the love of her master and his daughter and provokes the vengeful jealousy of his wife.<br /><br /><p>In this gentle fable about the power of stories to change people's lives, the heroine uses sources that include fairy tales and great works of literature to argue for women\u2019s rights and the humanity of slaves, and to inspire herself and others to be resourceful, courageous and independent. Miranda's own life becomes as mythic as the stories she tells. In a narrative that is part adventure, part romance, and part fantasy, the heroine triumphs over adversity and makes a place for herself in the world of the past.</p><br /><br /><p>Visit the companion web site at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rebecca-east.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.rebecca-east.com</a> to see ancient works of art that inspired the descriptions of characters and settings.</p>"

        "abstract": "Pompeii's tragedy is our windfall: an ancient city fully preserved, its urban design and domestic styles speaking across the ages. This richly illustrated book conducts us through the captured wonders of Pompeii, evoking at every turn the life of the city as it was 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />When Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. its lava preserved not only the Pompeii of that time but a palimpsest of the city's history, visible traces of the different societies of Pompeii's past. Paul Zanker, a noted authority on Roman art and architecture, disentangles these tantalizing traces to show us the urban images that marked Pompeii's development from country town to Roman imperial city. Exploring Pompeii's public buildings, its streets and gathering places, we witness the impact of religious changes, the renovation of theaters and expansion of athletic facilities, and the influence of elite families on the city's appearance. Through these stages, Zanker adeptly conjures a sense of the political and social meanings in urban planning and public architecture.<br /><br />The private houses of Pompeii prove equally eloquent, their layout, decor, and architectural detail speaking volumes about the life, taste, and desires of their owners. At home or in public, at work or at ease, these Pompeians and their world come alive in Zanker's masterly rendering. A provocative and original reading of material culture, his work is an incomparable introduction to urban life in antiquity."

One who wants to get joy of book reading especially in very less time can go for it. About The Book The Last Days of Pompeii \"The Last Days of Pompeii,\" the most popular of Lytton's historical romances, was begun and almost completed at Naples in the winter of 1832-3, and was first published in 1834. The period dealt with is that of 79 A.D., during the short reign of Titus, when Rome was at its zenith and the picturesque Campanian city a kind of Rome-by-the-Sea. Lytton wrote the novel some thirty years before the excavations of Pompeii had been systematically begun; but his pictures of the life, the luxuries, the pastimes and the gaiety of the half-Grecian colony, its worship of Isis, its trade with Alexandria, and the early struggles of Christianity with heathen superstition are exceptionally vivid. The creation of Nydia, the blind flower-girl, was suggested by the casual remark of an acquaintance that at the time of the destruction of Pompeii the sightless would have found the easiest deliverance.

Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own. Eventually they find work on a ranch in California\u2019s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America\u2019s lonely and dispossessed, <i>Of Mice and Men</i> has proved one of Steinbeck\u2019s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films."

And in these lairs, men trade the most devastatingly effective techniques ever invented to charm women. This is <em>not</em> fiction. These men really exist. They live together in houses known as Projects. And Neil Strauss, the bestselling author, spent two years living among them, using the pseudonym Style to protect his real-life identity. The result is one of the most explosive and controversial books of the year -- guaranteed to change the lives of men and transform the way women understand the opposite sex forever.<br /><br />On his journey from AFC (average frustrated chump) to PUA (pick-up artist) to PUG (pick-up guru), Strauss not only shares scores of original seduction techniques but also has unforgettable encounters with the likes of Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Heidi Fleiss, and Courtney Love. And then things really start to get strange -- and passions lead to betrayals lead to violence. <strong>The Game</strong> is the story of one man's transformation from frog to prince -- to prisoner in the most unforgettable book of the year."

        "abstract": "Bestselling author Jim Cramer shows investors how to use the information and advice in his top-rated CNBC show<i> </i>to make money in the stock market.<br /><br />\"Investing well isn't easy, but it is possible. My goal in life is to make it easier for you to make money.\"<br /><br /> Jim Cramer is the champion of the middle-class investor. Every night on <i>Mad Money,</i> he provides valuable information about stocks, steering investors away from danger zones and leading them to the investments that can turn a lackluster portfolio into a powerhouse of profit. In his new book, he shows investors how to take the advice on his TV program and put it into action.<br /><br /> Cramer walks investors through the key decisions they have to make: understanding their tolerance for risk and defining their goals, doing the essential homework on a stock, and knowing how to buy and sell stocks the right way -- the Cramer way. This is a true nuts-and-bolts guide to investing, from Cramer's detailed discussion of the sort of homework investors must do to his own guidelines for knowing when and how to sell stocks.<br /><br /><i>Mad Money</i> is a hugely entertaining television program, but it also offers valuable information that can be the basis for a winning portfolio. Cramer shows how to turn the \"Lightning Round\" into a terrific tool for investing; it's stock-market strength training. He reveals how he can assess a stock in only seconds -- a valuable skill that every investor can acquire and put to good use. He explains what to look for in his CEO and CFO interviews, and how to use those conversations to make successful investment decisions. He reviews some of his best calls made on <i>Mad Money,</i> as well as some of his worst ones, to extract ten lessons from each that can profit every investor. And for the <i>Mad Money</i> junkies who just can't get enough, Cramer goes behind the scenes to explain everything from the reason behind his deliberate mispronunciations to his notorious chair abuse to the zany props and buttons that keep things humming.<br /><br /> From the first \"Booyah\" to the last roar of the bull, <i>Mad Money</i> is every investor's favorite television program, and Jim Cramer's <i>Mad Money</i> is the book that can turn a TV program into a top-notch stock portfolio."

        "abstract": "In January of 1994, Nicholas Maier hopped on a train that took him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he lived with his parents, to New York's Penn Station. With his wallet stuck in his sock, he headed down to the heart of the Wall Street district for a meeting with Jim Cramer that would change his life forever. For the next five years, Maier would work like a slave inside Jim Cramer's hedge fund, a limited partnership that included only the wealthiest investors, where rules were scarce and where, in his glory days, Jim Cramer managed almost a half a billion dollars, raking in phenomenal returns. Entranced by the game, Maier quickly rose from the office assistant fetching sandwiches from the deli downstairs to a trader playing with a fifty-million-dollar portfolio. But under the pressure of Jim's constant war, Maier's adrenaline rush wore off, and the dark side of Wall Street was revealed: Maier had become exhausted and money driven -- at his worst moments swapping tranquilizers with his coworkers and passing out on a New York subway.<br /><br />This is a true insider's story -- an honest, raw, page-turning account that takes us on a journey through the volatile, anything-goes world of hedge funds. From Cramer &amp; Company to the brokerage houses and analysts to the reporters who cover the market action, we are shown a Wall Street where almost everyone is dirty -- a world where even the SEC fails to maintain order.<br /><br />At the heart of this narrative is an incredible character study of Jim Cramer, one of Wall Street's brightest stars. Employing any means possible to make money, Cramer engaged in brilliant but questionable strategies that danced on the edge of ethics and legality. A typicalday inside the fund would begin with Cramer's declaration, \"I love the smell of money in the morning,\" followed by a boom-box serenade of Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise.\" At the first sign of trouble, however, Cramer would turn paranoid and vicious, smashing phones and computer monitors and screaming insults that would leave even the toughest employees in tears.<br /><br />In the tradition of \"Liar's Poker,\" this fascinating account of greed and excess on Wall Street will inevitably force the business world to reassess itself through the story of one young man who walked away from it all."

        "abstract": "While there have been many great investment books written about how to identify winning stock ideas, there are few that explain how to dodge the losers. It's a crucial lesson to learn. The capitalist system regularly produces characters so destructive that they shake the nation's financial system to its very foundation. The losses these rogues generate extend well beyond those incurred by company stakeholders. Corporate scandals sap investor confidence, savage the stock market, and often deal a blow to the whole economy. The Forewarned Investor identifies common manifestations of fraud visible to investors. The presence of a number of these danger signs should alert investors that the risk level associated with investing in a specific company's stock is elevated, and it is incrediby probable if something is amiss. When an investor encounters a collection of these danger signs, he should follow the lead of a poker player with a lousy hand and fold."

But with his discretion, his reliability, and his unique talent for death by \"natural causes,\" no one is willing to let him just retire. So when an old nemesis from the Japanese national police force comes to him with a new job--eliminate Murakami, a killer even more fearsome than Rain himself--Rain knows he can't refuse.<p>Aided by an achingly desirable half Brazilian, half Japanese exotic dancer he knows he shouldn't trust, Rain pursues his quarry through underground no-holds-barred fight clubs, mobbed-up hostess bars, and finally into the heart of a shadow war between the CIA and the yakuza. It's a war Rain can't win, but also one he can't afford to lose--a war where the distinctions between friend and foe and truth and deceit are as murky as the rain-slicked streets of Tokyo.</p><p>\"... a superlative job... entertaining and suspenseful enough to keep you turning the pages as fast as your eyes can follow.\" --Chicago Sun Times</p>"

I'd never written more than an occasional letter to the editor in my life. My twisted insides had spawned ulcers. The nightmares were more frequent. I needed to get Vietnam out into the open, but I couldn't talk about it. Not after all those years. <br />Thus begins John Ketwig's powerful memoir of the Vietnam War. Now, over 15 years after its initial publication, Sourcebooks is proud to bring ...and a hard rain fell back into print in a newly updated edition, with a new introduction by the author and eight pages of never-before-published photographs. <br />From the country roads of upstate New York to the jungles of Vietnam, and finally to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., ...and a hard rain fell is a gripping and visceral account of one young man's struggle to make sense of his place in a world gone mad.<br />"

He charts the mercurial shifts of the Dylan persona, from acoustic to electric, and assesses the singer's debt to earlier muscians aw well as his influence on such performers as the Byrds, Bruce Springsteen, and Elvis Costello.<br /><br />Includes a new epilogue that examines Dylan's 30th anniversary celebration and his 1998 Grammy Award comeback."

        "abstract": "A stunning visual companion to the highly anticipated new film from director Rob Marshall (<em>Chicago</em>), based on the international bestseller by Arthur Golden\u2014a major holiday release from Columbia Pictures.<br /><br />Featuring over 150 full-color photographs and drawings, this lavishly illustrated book captures the artistry and romance behind the exquisite new film from Rob Marshall, the director of the Oscar\u00ae-winning film Chicago, starring Ziyi Zhang (<em>House of Flying Daggers</em>) and Ken Watanabe (<em>The Last Samurai</em>).<br /><br />Directed by Academy Award\u00ae-nominee Rob Marshall (<em>Chicago</em>) and produced by Lucy Fisher, Douglas Wick, and Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Robin Swicord and Doug Wright, Memoirs of a Geisha features an all-star Asian cast including Michelle Yeoh (<em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>), Koji Yakusho (<em>Shall We Dance?</em>), Youki Kudoh (<em>Snow Falling on Cedars</em>), and Gong Li (<em>Raise the Red Lantern</em>).<br /><br />Based on the internationally acclaimed novel by Arthur Golden, Memoirs of a Geisha is a sweeping romantic epic set in the mysterious and exotic world that still casts a potent spell today. The story begins in the years before WWII when a penniless Japanese child is torn from her family to work as a servant in a geisha house. Despite a treacherous rival who nearly breaks her spirit, the girl blossoms into the legendary geisha Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang). Beautiful and accomplished, Sayuri captivates the most powerful men of her day, but is haunted by her secret love for the one man who is out of her reach (Ken Watanabe).<br /><br />The Newmarket Pictorial Moviebook explores the intricate process of re-creating the period and world of the geisha. Special sections showcase production design, makeup, choreography, and costumes, featuring kimonos created especially for the movie by five-time Oscar\u00ae-nominated costume designer Colleen Atwood. Sidebars throughout also provide fascinating historical background on the geisha culture. <br />"

        "abstract": "GEISHA, A LIFE \"\"No woman in the three-hundred-year history of the karyukai has ever come forward in public to tell her story. We have been constrained by unwritten rules not to do so, by the robes of tradition and by the sanctity of our exclusive calling...But I feel it is time to speak out.\"\"<br /><br />Celebrated as the most successful geisha of her generation, Mineko Iwasaki was only five years old when she left her parents' home for the world of the geisha. For the next twenty-five years, she would live a life filled with extraordinary professional demands and rich rewards. She would learn the formal customs and language of the geisha, and study the ancient arts of Japanese dance and music. She would enchant kings and princes, captains of industry, and titans of the entertainment world, some of whom would become her dearest friends. Through great pride and determination, she would be hailed as one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, and one of the last great practitioners of this now fading art form.<br /><br />In \"Geisha, a Life,\" Mineko Iwasaki tells her story, from her warm early childhood, to her intense yet privileged upbringing in the Iwasaki okiya (household), to her years as a renowned geisha, and finally, to her decision at the age of twenty-nine to retire and marry, a move that would mirror the demise of geisha culture. Mineko brings to life the beauty and wonder of Gion Kobu, a place that \"existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past.\" She illustrates how it coexisted within post-World War II Japan at a time when the country was undergoing its radical transformation from apost-feudal society to a modern one.<br /><br />\"There is much mystery and misunderstanding about what it means to be a geisha. I hope this story will help explain what it is really like and also serve as a record of this unique component of Japan's cultural history,\" writes Mineko Iwasaki. \"Geisha, a Life\" is the first of its kind, as it delicately unfolds the fabric of a geisha's development. Told with great wisdom and sensitivity, it is a true story of beauty and heroism, and of a time and culture rarely revealed to the Western world."

You'll learn when to play hard to get (and when not to), how long you should wait to ask him or her out, and how to make an unforgettable first impression. In addition, the author will teach you how to discover and exude a sense of the deeper qualities the man or woman you have chosen longs for in a lifetime partner. Finally, she demonstrates the subtle techniques for discovering ( and fulfilling) your partner's sexual cravings."

        "abstract": "The five love languages work for everyone (they're not just for married couples)... In this world we\u2019re surrounded by more people than ever\u2014yet we often still feel alone. Being single or married has nothing to do with whether you need to feel loved! Everyone has a God-given yearning for complete and unconditional love in the context of all relationships. If you want to give and receive love most effectively, you\u2019ve got to learn to speak the right love language. Different people with different personalities express love in different ways. In fact, there are five very specific languages of love: Words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, quality time, and physical touch.\u00a0 Dr. Gary Chapman\u2019s original bestseller was first crafted with married couples in mind, but the love languages have proven themselves to be universal. The message of this audiobook is now tailored to meet the unique and real desires of single adults.\u00a0 Insert disc 5 into your PC to access the PDF material."

        "abstract": "Who is your teenager listening to? Teenagers today are bombarded by messages from their peers, the Internet, music, movies . . . the list goes on. As parents, you may wonder if your words mean anything at all. If so, take heart: all research indicates that the most significant influence on the life of a teenager comes from his or her parents. Yes--parents! In this updated volume, marriage and family expert Dr. Gary Chapman lays out the tools you need to communicate with your teenager. As Dr. Chapman states, \"At the root of much teenage misbehavior is a teen's empty love tank. I am not suggesting that parents do not love their teenagers; I am suggesting that thousands of teenagers do not feel that love. For most parents, it is not a matter of sincerity but rather lack of information on how to communicate love effectively on an emotional level.\" Starting with the world in which your teenager lives, Dr. Chapman walks through the emotional needs of teenagers and how you can best express your love to them. You'll learn how to identify your teenager's love language, how to address their unique need for independence and responsibility, how to combat anger and set up boundaries, and how to best parent your teenager if you are a single parent or a blended family."

        "abstract": "Unhappiness in marriage often has a simple root cause: we speak different love languages, believes Dr. Gary Chapman. While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their \"love tank.\" Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse's - and your own - love language? Chapman's short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusive Amazon.com bonus). Each section of the journal corresponds with a chapter from the book, offering opportunities for deeper reflection on your marriage. </p><p> Although some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like -hoping the feelings of affection will follow later- a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort. \"Love is a choice,\" says Chapman. \"And either partner can start the process today.\" --<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>"

The Illuminati has surfaced from the shadows to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy... the Catholic Church. <br /><br />Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces he has hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. <br /><br />Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair... a secret location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. <br /><br />An explosive international thriller, Angels &amp; Demons careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war."

        "abstract": "This sumptuously illustrated volume analyzes artists' representations of angels and demons and heaven and hell from the Judeo-Christian tradition and describes how these artistic portrayals evolved over time. As with other books in the Guide to Imagery series, the goal of this volume is to help contemporary art enthusiasts decode the symbolic meanings in the great masterworks of Western Art.<br /> The first chapter traces the development of images of the Creation and the Afterworld from descriptions of them in the Scriptures through their evolution in later literary and philosophical works. The following two chapters examine artists' depictions of the two paths that humans may take, the path of evil or the path of salvation, and the punishments or rewards found on each. A chapter on the Judgment Day and the end of the world explores portrayals of the mysterious worlds between life and death and in the afterlife. Finally, the author looks at images of angelic and demonic beings themselves and how they came to be portrayed with the physical attributes--wings, halos, horns, and cloven hooves--with which we are now so familiar.<br /> Thoroughly researched by and expert in the field of iconography, Angels and Demons in Art will delight readers with an interest in art or religious symbolism."

The Illuminati has surfaced from the shadows to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy... the Catholic Church. <br /><br />Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces he has hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. <br /><br />Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair... a secret location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. <br /><br />An explosive international thriller, Angels &amp; Demons careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war."

        "abstract": "One of the oldest myths in business is that every customer is a valuable customer. Even in the age of high-tech data collection, many businesses don't realize that some of their customers are deeply unprofitable, and that simply doing business with them is costing them money. In many places, it's typical that the top 20 percent of customers are generating almost all the profit while the bottom 20 percent are actually destroying value. Managers are missing tremendous opportunities if they are not aware which of their customers are truly profitable and which are not.<br />\u00a0<br />According to Larry Selden and Geoff Colvin, there is a way to fix this problem: manage your business not as a collection of products and services but as a customer portfolio. Selden and Colvin show readers how to analyze customer data to understand how you can get the most out of your most critical customer segments. The authors reveal how some companies (such as Best Buy and Fidelity Investments) have already moved in this direction, and what customer-centric strategies are likely to become widespread in the coming years.For corporate leaders, middle managers, or small business owners, this book offers a breakthrough plan to delight their best customers and drive shareowner value."

        "abstract": "People are talking. \"The DaVinci Code\" has been on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list for almost a year and is raising a variety of responses from Christians and non-Christians alike. Some are outraged and upset by the claims of Dan Brown, while others are left utterly confused and don't know what to believe. \"The DaVinci Code: Fact or Fiction?\" shatters the myths of the book while showing the reliability of Scripture, the divinity of Christ, as well as the historical facts for the Priory of Zion and the Knight's Templar. This is the only hands-on, accessible reference guide. \"The DaVinci Code: Fact or Fiction?\" even helps you turn debate about the book into an evangelistic opportunity."

        "abstract": "When a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory...a victory that has profound implications for U.S. space policy and the impending presidential election. <br /><br />With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery -- a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy. <br /><br />But before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly team of assassins controlled by a mysterious power broker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. <br /><br />The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all."

        "abstract": "Previously published as Rain Storm and Choke Point<br /><br />John Rain has disappeared to Brazil to escape the killing business and the enemies encircling him in Japan. But the CIA isn't willing to lose its premier \"natural causes\" contract killer, and they force Rain to take on a high-risk assignment: eliminate a ruthless arms dealer operating in Southeast Asia.<br /><br />The upside? Financial, of course, along with the ongoing chimera of moral redemption. But first, Rain will have to survive the downside: a second assassin zeroing in on the target; the target's consort, an alluring and dangerous woman with an agenda of her own; the possibility that the entire mission is nothing but an elaborate setup. From the gorgeous beaches of Rio to the glitzy casinos of Macau to the gritty back streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, Rain becomes a reluctant player in an international game far deadlier and more insidious than any he has encountered before.<br /><br />\"In his superb thriller series featuring charismatic Japanese-American assassin John Rain, author Barry Eisler serves up steamy foreign locales, stunning action and enough high-tech weaponry to make for an A-plus boys-and-their-toys read.\"<br />--New York Daily News<br /><br />Includes a note from the author introducing the new edition."

        "abstract": "A perennial favorite, reprinted for a new generation. Jan Adkins' young adult novel sends a spunky but alienated teenager back through time in \"a storm without rain\" to his New England home town in 1904, where he becomes the best friend, shipmate and co-conspirator to his own grandfather at his age. More than a fantasy, the town and times and most of the people the boys meet are factual. The textures, smells, sounds and sights of a vanished era return in this compelling narrative. What a young man learns about family, love and the march of time might just affect you as well."

Marked to inherit millions, Rain faced the fury of her unaccepting mother, her manipulative stepfather, and her cold, vicious Aunt Victoria. But no amount of money can keep Rain's world from crashing down when sudden tragedy strikes. <br /><br />Left helpless after a devastating blow, Rain sinks into despair as her precious dreams are washed away - dreams that cannot be bought with the Hudson fortune. Her only hope for rebuilding her life rests in trusting a stranger who has come into her world \u2014 a man whose generosity and kindness does not appear to come with strings attached, much to Rain's amazement. But just as she opens her heart to a promising new future, her past comes back to haunt her \u2014 and Rain is pulled into a furious whirlpool of bitterness and heartache."

        "abstract": "\"Most Americans are not free. They are chained to their paychecks............The women profiled herein will not tolerate such an existence. They are a different breed. They are free. They are cultivators of wealth and satisfied with life.\"<br /><br /> Dr. Thomas J. Stanley first swept aside the mythical magic curtain of wealth with <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i>, revealing just who and how common the truly wealthy were in this country as well as the characteristics and habits that made them so. With <i>Millionaire Women Next Door</i>, he now focuses on one of the least understood but increasingly rich demographics.<br /><br /> \"Why write another book that profiles millionaires?\" Stanley asks. \"The vast majority of the millionaire respondents (92 percent) in <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i> were men............ I felt that it was indeed time for successful businesswomen of the self-made variety to be heard.\" And heard they are in this book that is every bit as informative and inspirational as the author's earlier works. Stanley's thoroughly researched findings and conclusions will fascinate readers everywhere. They'll definitely come away more knowledgeable and greatly inspired by women who have found the key to riches."

        "abstract": "<i>Think and Grow Rich</i> has been called the \"Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature.\" It was the first book to boldly ask, \"What makes a winner?\" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself. The most famous of all teachers of success spent \"a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort\" to produce the \"Law of Success\" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.<br /><br />In the original <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers."

Mr. Hill came to our campus as the commencement speaker that year. As I listened to him, I heard something other than the words he spoke. I felt the substance\u2014the wisdom\u2014and the spirit of a man and his philosophy. Mr. Hill said \"the most powerful instrument we have in our hand is the power of the mind.' Napoleon Hill compiled this philosophy of American achievement for the benefit of all people. I strongly commend this philosophy to you for achievement and service in your chosen field.\" \u2014Senator Jennings Randolph, West Virginia"

Learn how to use Subversion the right way-the pragmatic way.<br /><br />With this book, you can:<br /><br /><br />Keep all project assets safe--not just source code--and never run the risk of losing a great idea Know how to undo bad decisions--even directories and symlinks are versioned Learn how to share code safely, and work in parallel for maximum efficiency Install Subversion and organize, administer and backup your repository Share code over a network with Apache, svnserve, or ssh Create and manage releases, code branches, merges and bug fixes Manage 3rd party code safely Use all the latest Subversion 1.3 features including locking and path-based security, and much more!<br />Now there's no excuse not to use professional-grade version control."

        "abstract": "One of the greatest frustrations in most software projects is version control: the art of managing changes to information. Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play.<br /><br />Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, <i>Version Control with Subversion</i> introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS. CVS users will find the \"look and feel\" Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws.<br /><br />The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure. With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor. Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control. The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide.<br /><br /><i>Version Control with Subversion</i> aims to be useful to readers of widely different backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins. If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.<br />"

Rooney clearly explains how to integrate Subversion with common development tools and illustrates how to embed Subversion within your own programs. Multiple appendices compare SVN to other version control systems and offer alternative client applications."

Nivedita Menon explores the relationship between law and feminist politics by examining the contemporary Indian women's movement with comparisons to France and the United States. She argues that the intersection of feminist politics, law, and the state often paradoxically and severely distorts important ethical and emancipatory impulses of feminism. Menon reviews historical challenges to the liberal notion of rights from Marxist, feminist, postcolonial, and critical legal scholars, and analyzes current Indian debates on topics including abortion, sexual violence, and Parliamentary quotas for women. Far from being a call to withdraw from the arena of law, \"Recovering Subversion\" instead urges feminists everywhere to recognize the limits of \"rights discourse\" and pleads for a politics that goes beyond its boundaries."

Read My Lips: Sexual Subversion and the tend of Gender, a frontal assault on both the status quo in academic studies and the full spectrum of single-issue identity politics, will change the way you think about bodies, sex, and gender. Yours and everyone else's.Combining the theoretical breakthroughs of Judith Butler's Gender Trouble and the performance revelations of Kate Bornstein's Gender Outlaw, Wilchins -- cofounder of the Transsexual Menace -- moves the dialogue to a new level. In a voice that is by turns outraged, outrageous, sad, and hilarious, the author weaves theory and personal experience into a compelling story of self-discovery. She redefines what it means to be \"gendered\", both by the way she lives and the accessible theoretical narrative she constructs.<br /><br />Read My Lips, with its unique mix of theory and application, anecdote and affront, will appeal to feminists, queer academics, activists, transpeople, \"the-queer-on-the-street\", and the increasing audience of mainstream readers hungry for writing that pushes the absolute edge of the gender envelope.<br /><br />OUT Magazine says that the author \"has surfaced as the Superhero of this burgeoning (transgender) movement\". Wilchins, herself, signs off on her email as follows: \"Just your average straight white guy with a cunt who really digs lezzie chicks like me\". Rarely have smarts and chutzpah produced such good effect."

        "abstract": "The host of the hit reality show The Apprentice presents an invaluable collection of grounded, hard-hitting advice on business success, from people who have made it to the boss s chair at some of America s most thriving companies. <br />How can you find the way to the top? <br />Ask people who are already there. <br />Because you can t know it all. No matter how smart you are, no matter how comprehensive your education, no matter how wide-ranging your business experience, there s simply no way to acquire all the wisdom you need to make your business flourish. You need to learn from those who have blazed a trail before you. <br />Donald Trump has asked many of the brightest, most successful businesspeople he knows and some he doesn't know to answer this question: What's the best business advice you ever received? The result is a compelling resource of wisdom and wit that reveals how some of the most accomplished people conduct their personal and business affairs, giving an inside look into the secrets of corporate success. But the advice doesn t only come from the upper echelons of the Fortune 500. Thoughts poured in from executives at thriving companies large and small, ranging from well-known icons such as Staples, American Airlines, Lillian Vernon, and Boeing to family-run operations like Orleans Homebuilders and Carlson Companies. <br />The Way to the Top brings together the core ideas that have guided more than 150 of today s top businesspeople, offering a range of inspiring and practical advice on making good decisions, conducting yourself appropriately, developing your career, communicating with others, leading a team effectively, and much more. Some of the entries are simple entreaties, some portray intriguing vignettes, and others outline lists of guiding principles; all are illuminating, instructive, and insightful. <br />A telling to-do list for the aspiring professional, The Way to the Top belongs on every business bookshelf.\""

The Chicago-bred performer and royal king of the Original Kings of Comedy has won over countless fans of cutting comedy and family humor with an edgy show that tells it like it is but never loses heart. No surprise, Mac has earned a reputation as perhaps the truest voice of modern humor. Here, in his debut book, Mac brilliantly captures the R-rated side of his comedic genius in print. <br /> Touring through a wide range of topics with equal parts insight and irreverence, Bernie Mac presents a way of looking at the world guaranteed to make you laugh. Tackling superstar athletes, the movie business, his fellow comedians, his marriage, and, of course, his friends and family, Mac offers side-splitting riffs on sex, religion, hygiene, money, and more. Nobody is safe; nothing is sacred. Not even Bernie himself. Throughout <i>I Ain't Scared of You,</i> Mac turns his humor inward, firing off hilarious self-deprecating salvos about his golf game and his own hypocrisies. <br /> Bernie Mac's hit show and his vital live performances have earned him critical acclaim and international popularity. <i>Now, I Ain't Scared of You</i> reveals his humor whole -- unpretentious, unafraid, and unbelievably funny and raw."

        "abstract": "In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.<br /><br />Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, <i>1776</i> is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.<br /><br />At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.<br /><br />But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's <i>1776</i> is another landmark in the literature of American history."

Why did many thousands of Scottish Highlanders emigrate to America in the eighteenth century, and why did the majority of them rally to the defense of the Crown. . . . Offers the most complete and intelligent analysis of them that has so far appeared.--<i>William and Mary Quarterly</i><br /><br />Using a variety of original sources -- official papers, travel documents, diaries, and newspapers -- Duane Meyer presents an impressively complete reconstruction of the settlement of the Highlanders in North Carolina. He examines their motives for migration, their life in America, and their curious political allegiance to George III."

The state has been claimed at different times by more foreign countries than any of the other 13 British colonies. <br /><br />Aided by historical maps, archival illustrations, and first-person accounts, readers experience the chilling Indian massacre of the first European settlers and follow the events that helped the region develop into a thriving colony, as it changed from Swedish to Dutch to British control. They learn how Delaware provided Pennsylvania with vital access to the sea and became the subject of a dispute between William Penn and Maryland's Lord Baltimore. Readers also learn how Delaware's early support of independence helped it build a militia of nearly 4,000 men and how Delaware was first in line to ratify the Constitution for the newly created United States."

Focusing on America's encounter with the Barbary states of North Africa from 1776 to 1815, Robert Allison traces the perceptions and mis-perceptions of Islam in the American mind as the new nation constructed its ideology and system of government.<br /><br />\"A powerful ending that explains how the experience with the Barbary states compelled many Americans to look inward . . . with increasing doubts about the institution of slavery.\" \u2014David W. Lesch, <i>Middle East Journal</i><br /><br />\"Allison's incisive and informative account of the fledgling republic's encounter with the Muslim world is a revelation with a special pertinence to today's international scene.\" \u2014Richard W. Bulliet, <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i><br /><br />\"This book should be widely read. . . . Allison's study provides a context for understanding more recent developments, such as America's tendency to demonize figures like Iran's Khumaini, Libya's Qaddafi, and Iraq's Saddam.\" \u2014Richard M. Eaton, <i>Eighteenth Century Studies</i><br />"

The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family. Nearby, the nobles of the House of Hwang consider themselves above the land and its workers; but they will soon meet their own downfall.<br /><br />Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family when flood and drought force them to seek work in the city. The working people riot, breaking into the homes of the rich and forcing them to flee. When Wang Lung shows mercy to one noble and is rewarded, he begins to rise in the world, even as the House of Hwang falls."

        "abstract": "We are what we eat, as the saying goes. So it follows that if we want to be healthy, we should buy healthy foods. And for foods to be healthy, the earth they grow in also needs to be in good health. This might seem like Ecology 101, but it\u2019s what many supermarket shoppers are grappling with nowadays as they try to decide what to feed the family.<br /><br /><i>The Eco-Foods Guide </i>is a lively conversation with consumers that takes the gloom out of our grocery choices and empowers shoppers to vote with their food dollars for the environment and for a safe future for their grandchildren. Frankenfoods and more have made food shopping so frightening and complex that the result has often been paralysis or denial. But in this optimistic and even humorous jaunt through the topic, sustainable agriculture expert Cynthia Barstow encourages readers to walk away bubbling with opportunities to buy what\u2019s best\u2014most of the time\u2014and to even engage with the many others working to effect change in agriculture.<br /><br />In a straightforward style, <i>The Eco-Foods Guide </i>ex-amines the downside: pesticides and growth hormones, biotechnology and processed foods, manufacturing concentration and animal husbandry, and the overuse of nonrenewable resources. At the same time, it highlights alternatives and solutions, including:<br /><br />\u2022 Eating seasonally<br /><br />\u2022 Buying local<br /><br />\u2022 Reforming school cafeteria menus<br /><br />\u2022 Shopping at farmer\u2019s markets<br /><br />\u2022 Eating at Chef\u2019s Collaborative restaurants<br /><br />\u2022 Supporting labeling, organic, and IPM production methods<br /><br />\u2022 Regarding our food again as sacred<br /><br /><b>Cynthia Barstow </b>is adjunct faculty at the University of Massachusetts and an environmental/sustainable agriculture marketing consultant and speaker. Previously VP of marketing for a $3 billion Manhattan restaurant, her clients have included the World Wildlife Fund and the University of Wisconsin Madison \"Protected Harvest\" eco-label program."

        "abstract": "A groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.<br /><br />Are we what we eat? To a degree both engrossing and alarming, the story of fast food is the story of postwar America. Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. <br /><br />That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning. Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job -- meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations. <br /><br />Along the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food. Fast Food Nation is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats."

        "abstract": "<i>Fast Food Nation</i>, Eric Schlosser's disturbing and timely exploration of one of the world's most controversial industries, has become a massive bestseller in America and rightly deserves to be so this side of the pond. On any given day, one out of four Americans opts for a quick and cheap meal at a fast-food restaurant, without giving either its speed or its cheapness a second thought. Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems harmless. But the industry's drive for consolidation, homogenisation and speediness has radically transformed the West's diet, landscape, economy and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways.<p>Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating expos\u00e9 with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. However, he rapidly moves behind the counter to the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world's largest flavour company) and \"what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns\". Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--faeces in your meat. </p><p> Schlosser's investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of regulation. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting and unsanitary practices that introduced E.coli and other pathogens into restaurants, schools and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry \"both feeds and feeds off the young\", insinuating itself into all aspects of children's lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. \"Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behaviour\", he writes. Where to begin? Ask yourself, is the true cost of having it \"your way\" really worth it? --<i>Lesley Reed</i></p>"
