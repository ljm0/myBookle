        "biography": "See also: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/383606.Robert_Galbraith\" title=\"Robert Galbraith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Galbraith</a><br />Although she writes under the pen name <b>J.K. Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, \"No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry.\" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (n\u00e9e Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: \"I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee.\" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said \"taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,\" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, \"I wasn\u2019t particularly happy. I think it\u2019s a dreadful time of life.\" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, \"Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of.\" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.\" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.",

        "biography": "Educated at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, Mary GrandPre began her career as a conceptual illustrator for local editorial clients. Continually experimenting with media, Mary underwent many artistic changes in her expressive visual form. Her concerns for light, color, drawing, and design came together in evocative, ethereal pastel paintings evolving toward a style she now calls \"soft geometry\". <br />Mary's new work attracted corporate advertising and editorial clients. Some of the include: Ogilvy &amp; Mather, BBD&amp;O, Whittle Communications, The Richards Group, Neenah Paper, Atlantic Monthly Magazine, Random House, Berkley, Penguin, Dell and McGraw Hill publishers. Recently, she was featured on the cover of Time Magazine for her work with the Harry Potter Series and also worked as a visionary in the environment/scenery development in Dreamworks animated film Antz<br /><br />Mary's work has received national recognition through awards received from: The Society of Illustrators, Communication Arts, Graphis, Print and Art Direction. Her work was chosen among thousands of illustrators to be on the cover of Showcase 16, and a n article was written about her \"conceptual editorial assignments\" in Step-by-Step Graphics. Communications Arts Magazine has also done a \"career retrospective\" article in their January/Febuary 200 edition.<br /><br />Additionally, Mary has now illustrated six beatiful children's books and is at work on the seventh. Her book illustration possesses higly personalized lyrical story interpretations and has received very favorable reviews in the national press.<br /><br />It is unusual for an illustrator to work successfully in so many genres of illustration at one time, from advertising and corporate to editorial and children's books. Her reputation is now world renown for her delightfully stunning illustrations.<br />",

Hitchhiker's began on radio, and developed into a \"trilogy\" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a television series, a comic book series, a computer game, and a feature film that was completed after Adams' death. The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams. He was known to some fans as Bop Ad (after his illegible signature), or by his initials \"DNA\".<br /><br />In addition to <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the Dirk Gently novels, and he co-wrote two Liff books and <i>Last Chance to See</i>, itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game <i>Starship Titanic</i>, which was produced by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by Terry Jones. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359.The_Salmon_of_Doubt\" title=\"The Salmon of Doubt\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Salmon of Doubt</a>\n</i> in 2002.<br /><br />His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the Macintosh computer, and other \"techno gizmos\". <br /><br />Toward the end of his life he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment.",

He was a close friend of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1069006.C_S__Lewis\" title=\"C.S. Lewis\" rel=\"nofollow\">C.S. Lewis</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9533.Christopher_Tolkien\" title=\"Christopher Tolkien\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christopher Tolkien</a> published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7332.The_Silmarillion\" title=\"The Silmarillion\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silmarillion</a>\n</i>. These, together with <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the word \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings. <br /><br />While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature\u2014or more precisely, high fantasy. Tolkien's writings have inspired many other works of fantasy and have had a lasting effect on the entire field.<br /><br />In 2008, <i>The Times</i> ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". <i>Forbes</i> ranked him the 5th top-earning dead celebrity in 2009.<br /><br /><b>Religious influences</b><br />J.R.R. Tolkien, was born in South Africa in 1892, but his family moved to Britain when he was about 3 years old. When Tolkien was 8 years old, his mother converted to Catholicism, and he remained a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, \u201cI\u2019m a devout Roman Catholic.\u201d <br /><br />Tolkien married his childhood sweetheart, Edith, and they had four children. He wrote them letters each year as if from Santa Claus, and a selection of these was published in 1976 as <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7331.The_Father_Christmas_Letters\" title=\"The Father Christmas Letters\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Father Christmas Letters</a>\n</i>. One of Tolkien\u2019s sons became a Catholic priest. Tolkien was an advisor for the translation of the <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108930.Jerusalem_Bible\" title=\"Jerusalem Bible\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jerusalem Bible</a>\n</i>. <br /><br />Tolkien once described <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> to his friend Robert Murray, an English Jesuit priest, as \"a fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.\" There are many theological themes underlying the narrative including the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of grace. In addition the saga includes themes which incorporate death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. In addition <i>The Lord's Prayer</i> \"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" was reportedly present in Tolkien's mind as he described Frodo's struggles against the power of the \"One Ring.''",

First published under Red Sage, she was able to write romantic fiction for the first time in 1996. She published several short stories in their Secrets anthologies. Editor Cindy Hwang brought her to Berkley Publishing and has helped her become a best selling author.<br /><br />When developing her Mageverse series she wanted to create a unique spin on the vampire tale. Taking the Arthurian legend and twisting it, she has vampires that are not evil, still possess their souls, and can reproduce. Merlin was an alien who traveled to Earth from the Mageverse (an alternate world where magic is everywhere) to establish protectors. Merlin's race had seen species that destroyed themselves as they advanced. To avoid this, he searched Earth for worthy men and women who would give everything to protect others. After drinking from the Grail, men became Magi, vampires and women became Majae, witches. They have a symbiotic relationship. The Magi have to drink blood from the Majae to help absorb the energies of the Mageverse. The Majae have to donate blood or they will suffer heart attack from excess blood and elevated pressure. The Majae are the magic in the Mageverse. The Magi also sleep during the day as another means of gaining magic. The men and women could theoretically live forever, should they not be killed.<br /><br />They are capable of reproducing with mortals to ensure that there are more potential candidates to recruit. Anyone born of such a union is a Latent. Their Gift, becoming Magi or Majae, is triggered by three or sexual encounters with a Gifted man or woman. A Latent must be approved by the Magi or Majae councils. Many can not psychologically handle the impact of the Mageverse (It can trigger insanity). There are professional court seducers who Gift latents on the Councils orders.<br /><br />On Mageverse Earth, there are Fairies, Dragons, Unicorns and the city of Avalon where the Magi and Majae live. They magically create gates to travel to Realspace Earth. The Fairies are featured in Master of the Moon, which has King Llyr of the Faeries.<br /><br />Merlin, who knows that power can corrupt, created another magical species in case the Magi and Majae become out of control. These are werewolves. They do not have to wait until the full moon to change. They are a rigid society that has been hidden from their inception. In Master of Wolves, the werewolves declare themselves and fight alongside the Magi and the Fairies.<br /><br />Master of Swords introduces the dragons of Mageverse in more depth and the hero for Master of Dragons is introduced.<br /><br />Futuristic Books<br /><br />Jane's Warlord introduces Jane Colby, a 20th century reporter. Baran Arvid is sent back from the future to protect her from another time traveler, Druas. Druas travels back in time to commit the Jack the Ripper murders and his next target is Jane. Baran is a technologically and genetically enhanced human classified as a Warlord.<br /><br />Mercenaires is three short stories (originally published electronically) set in a future like Baran\u2019s. They can be technologically and genetically enhanced. Space travel has extended to other galaxies and other life forms have been discovered. Humans have established many new colonies on planets capable of sustaining life.",

She is married to David Lunde, a poet.<br /><br />According to Fantasy Book Review, Patricia McKillip grew up in Oregon, England, and Germany, and received a Bachelor of Arts (English) in 1971 and a Master of Arts in 1973 from San Jose State University.<br /><br />McKillip's stories usually take place in a setting similar to the Middle Ages. There are forests, castles, and lords or kings, minstrels, tinkers and wizards. Her writing usually puts her characters in situations involving mysterious powers that they don't understand. Many of her characters aren't even sure of their own ancestry. Music often plays an important role. Love between family members is also important in McKillip's writing, although members of her families often disagree.",

        "biography": "Beverly Cleary (born April 12, 1916) is the author of over 30 books for young adults and children. Her characters are normal children facing challenges that many of us face growing up, and her stories are liberally laced with humour. Some of her best known and loved characters are Ramona Quimby and her sister Beatrice (\"Beezus\"), Henry Huggins, and Ralph S. Mouse.<br /><br />Beverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn in McMinnville, Oregon. When she was 6, her family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she went to grammar and high school. She was slow in learning to read, due partly to her dissatisfaction with the books she was required to read and partly to an unpleasant first grade teacher. It wasn't until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books, when she started reading The Dutch Twins by Lucy Fitch Perkins. Thereafter, she was a frequent visitor to the library, though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read \u2014 those about children like herself.<br /><br />She moved to California to attend the University of California, Berkeley, and after graduation with a B.A in English in 1938, studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939. Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima, Washington, where she met many children who were searching for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself. In response, she wrote her first book, Henry Huggins, which was published in 1950. Beezus and Ramona, Cleary's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story, was published in 1955, although Beezus and Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins series as supporting characters.<br /><br />In 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland, California. The Clearys became parents to a set of twins, Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James, in 1955. Clarence Cleary died in 2004. Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel, California.<br /><br />She has also written two autobiographies, A Girl from Yamhill and My Own Two Feet.",

My steampunk fantasy adventures, CLOCKWORK ANGELS and CLOCKWORK LIVES, written with Neil Peart, legendary drummer from Rush, are two of my very favorite novels ever.

My original works include the Saga of Seven Suns series and the Nebula Award-nominated Assemblers of Infinity. I have also written several comic books including the Dark Horse Star Wars collection Tales of the Jedi written in collaboration with Tom Veitch, Predator titles (also for Dark Horse), and X-Files titles for Topps.<br /><br />I serve as a judge in the Writers of the Future contest.<br /><br />My wife is author Rebecca Moesta.

        "biography": "I was born illegitimately in 1933 in South Africa and spent my early childhood years in a small town deep in the heart of the Lebombo mountains.<br /><br />It was a somewhat isolated community and I grew up among farm folk and the African people. At the age of five I was sent to a boarding school which might be better described as a combination orphanage and reform school, where I learned to box - though less as a sport and more as a means to stay alive.<br /><br />But I survived to return to a small mountain town named Barberton in the North Eastern part of the country.<br /><br />Here I met Doc, a drunken German music teacher who spent the next few years filling my young mind with the wonders of nature as we roamed the high mountains. His was the best education I was ever to receive, despite the scholarship I won to a prestigious boy's school and thereafter to a university in England where I studied Journalism.<br /><br />I came to Australia because I was banned from returning to my own country.<br /><br />This was due to the fact that I had started a weekend school for Africans in the school hall of the prestigious boy's school I attended.<br /><br />One day the school hall was raided by the police who then branded me a Communist as they considered educating Africans a subversive act.<br /><br />While studying journalism, I met a wonderful Australian girl.<br /><br />\"Come to my country!\" Benita invited.<br /><br />I did, and soon after arriving in Australia, married her. Benita gave me three splendid sons, Brett, Adam and Damon. Brett, who married Ann has given me three lovely grandsons, Ben now 14, Jake is about to turn 12 and Marcus is almost 6 years old.<br /><br />I have lived all my Australian life in Sydney (the nicest place on earth) and, until I started writing fiction, made my career in advertising working as a copywriter and creative director.<br /><br />At the age of 55 I decided to take the plunge. I had been telling stories since the age of five and had always known I would be a writer some day, though life kept getting in the way until I realised that it was either now or never.<br /><br />Bryce Courtenay died at his home in Canberra, Australia. He was 79.<br /><br />Courtenay is survived by his second wife Christine Gee and his children Adam and Brett.",

Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works, the novels <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world's greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.<br /><br />His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as <i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i>, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.",

He was educated at home and at a private school. Shortly after the death of his mother in 1837 he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Army Engineering College. Dostoyevsky's father died in 1839, most likely of apoplexy, but it was rumored that he was murdered by his own serfs. Dostoyevsky graduated as a military engineer, but resigned in 1844 to devote himself to writing. His first novel, <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67326.Poor_Folk\" title=\"Poor Folk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poor Folk</a>\n</i> appeared in 1846.<br /><br />That year he joined a group of utopian socialists. He was arrested in 1849 and sentenced to death, commuted to imprisonment in Siberia. Dostoyevsky spent four years in hard labor and four years as a soldier in Semipalatinsk, a city in what it is today Kazakhstan.<br /><br />Dostoyevsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1854 as a writer with a religious mission and published three works that derive in different ways from his Siberia experiences: <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17877.The_House_of_the_Dead\" title=\"The House of the Dead\" rel=\"nofollow\">The House of the Dead</a>\n</i>, (1860) a fictional account of prison life, <i>The Insulted and Injured</i>, which reflects the author's refutation of naive Utopianism in the face of evil, and <i>Winter Notes on Summer Impressions</i>, his account of a trip to Western Europe.<br /><br />In 1857 Dostoyevsky married Maria Isaev, a 29-year old widow. He resigned from the army two years later. Between the years 1861 and 1863 he served as editor of the monthly periodical <i>Time</i>, which was later suppressed because of an article on the Polish uprising.<br /><br />In 1864-65 his wife and brother died and he was burdened with debts. His situation was made even worse by his gambling addiction. From the turmoil of the 1860s emerged <i>Notes from the Underground</i>, a psychological study of an outsider, which marked a major advancement in Dostoyevsky's artistic and creative development.<br /><br />In 1867 Dostoyevsky married Anna Snitkin, his 22-year old stenographer. They traveled abroad and returned in 1871. By the time of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> (1879-80), Dostoyevsky was recognized in his own country as one of its great writers.<br /><br />",

He is known best for his ironic and well-plotted novels examining class difference and hypocrisy in early 20th-century British society. His humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel <i>Howards End</i>: \"Only connect\".<br /><br />He had five novels published in his lifetime, achieving his greatest success with <i>A Passage to India</i> (1924) which takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. <br /><br />Forster's views as a secular humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. He is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised for his attachment to mysticism. His other works include <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> (1905), <i>The Longest Journey</i> (1907), <i>A Room with a View</i> (1908) and <i>Maurice</i> (1971), his posthumously published novel which tells of the coming of age of an explicitly gay male character.",

He is the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy at Yeshiva University, director of the Yeshiva Center for History and Philosophy of Science, and a professor at Johns Hopkins University.<br /><br />Achinstein received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard with a dissertation on Carnap's theory of probability. It was the German philosopher Carl G. Hempel, in a visit to Harvard in 1953\u20134 (replacing W.V. Quine who was on leave), that motivated him to pursue Philosophy of Science. Upon getting a Harvard Traveling Fellowship, Achinstein spent a year in Oxford in 1959 working under the guidance of P. F. Strawson. In Oxford he attended seminars and lectures delivered by Gilbert Ryle, A.J. Ayer, and J.L. Austin. Achinstein specializes in philosophy of science with strong interests in the history of science.<br /><br />Achinstein has taught for many years at Johns Hopkins University, where he is currently Professor of Philosophy. In Spring 2009, Achinstein began teaching at Yeshiva University as the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy and is the founder and director of the Center for History and Philosophy of Science of Yeshiva University, New York. He returned to Johns Hopkins in Spring 2011. He has held Guggenheim, NEH, and NSF fellowships, and has served as a visiting professor at MIT, Stanford, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br /><br />He is the author of five influential books in the history and philosophy of science. Among them are <i>Particles and Waves</i>, which received the prestigious Lakatos Award in 1993. This book is a study of methodological problems arising from three episodes in 19th century physics: the wave-particle debate about light, the development of the kinetic-molecular theory, and the discovery of the electron. In 2001, Achinstein published <i>The Book of Evidence</i>, a philosophical and historical study of various concepts of evidence employed in the sciences. A volume of his important collected essays over the years, <i>Evidence, Explanation, and Realism</i>, was published in the spring of 2010. A special volume honoring him, <i>Philosophy of Science Matters: The Philosophy of Peter Achinstein</i>, was published in 2011. In 2013, Achinstein published <i>Evidence and Method: Scientific Strategies of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell</i>.<br /><br /><i>Wikipedia</i>",

Her works reflect her strong interest in modern science: tesseracts, for example, are featured prominently in <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, mitochondrial DNA in <i>A Wind in the Door</i>, organ regeneration in <i>The Arm of the Starfish</i>, and so forth.<br /><br />\"Madeleine was born on November 29th, 1918, and spent her formative years in New York City. Instead of her school work, she found that she would much rather be writing stories, poems and journals for herself, which was reflected in her grades (not the best). However, she was not discouraged.<br /><br />At age 12, she moved to the French Alps with her parents and went to an English boarding school where, thankfully, her passion for writing continued to grow. She flourished during her high school years back in the United States at Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, vacationing with her mother in a rambling old beach cottage on a beautiful stretch of Florida beach.<br /><br />She went to Smith College and studied English with some wonderful teachers as she read the classics and continued her own creative writing. She graduated with honors and moved into a Greenwich Village apartment in New York. She worked in the theater, where Equity union pay and a flexible schedule afforded her the time to write! She published her first two novels during these years\u2014<i>A Small Rain</i> and <i>Ilsa</i>\u2014before meeting Hugh Franklin, her future husband, when she was an understudy in Anton Chekov's <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. They married during <i>The Joyous Season</i>.<br /><br />She had a baby girl and kept on writing, eventually moving to Connecticut to raise the family away from the city in a small dairy farm village with more cows than people. They bought a dead general store, and brought it to life for 9 years. They moved back to the city with three children, and Hugh revitalized his professional acting career. The family has kept the country house, Crosswicks, and continues to spend summers there.<br /><br />As the years passed and the children grew, Madeleine continued to write and Hugh to act, and they to enjoy each other and life. Madeleine began her association with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where she has been the librarian and maintained an office for more than thirty years. After Hugh's death in 1986, it was her writing and lecturing that kept her going. She has now lived through the 20th century and into the 21st and has written over 60 books and keeps writing. She enjoys being with her friends, her children, her grandchildren, and her great grandchildren.\"<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/madeleinelengle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/author/madele...</a><br /><br />Copyright \u00a9 2007 Crosswicks, Ltd.

        "biography": "Charles Willeford was a remarkably fine, talented and prolific writer who wrote everything from poetry to crime fiction to literary criticism throughout the course of his impressively long and diverse career. His crime novels are distinguished by a mean'n'lean sense of narrative economy and an admirable dearth of sentimentality. He was born as Charles Ray Willeford III on January 2, 1919 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Willeford's parents both died of tuberculosis when he was a little boy and he subsequently lived either with his grandmother or at boarding schools. Charles became a hobo in his early teens. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps at age sixteen and was stationed in the Philippines. Willeford served as a tank commander with the 10th Armored Division in Europe during World War II. He won several medals for his military service: the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and the Luxembourg Croix de Guerre. Charles retired from the army as a Master Sergeant. Willeford's first novel \"High Priest of California\" was published in 1953. This solid debut was followed by such equally excellent novels as \"Pick-Up\" (this book won a Beacon Fiction Award), \"Wild Wives,\" \"The Woman Chaser,\" \"Cockfighter\" (this particular book won the Mark Twain Award), and \"The Burnt Orange Heresy.\" Charles achieved his greatest commercial and critical success with four outstanding novels about hapless Florida homicide detective Hoke Moseley: \"Miami Blues,\" \"New Hope for the Dead,\" \"Sideswipe,\" and \"The Way We Die Now.\" Outside of his novels, he also wrote the short story anthology \"The Machine in Ward Eleven,\" the poetry collections \"The Outcast Poets\" and \"Proletarian Laughter,\" and the nonfiction book \"Something About A Soldier.\" Willeford attended both Palm Beach Junior College and the University of Miami. He taught a course in humanities at the University of Miami and was an associate professor who taught classes in both philosophy and English at Miami Dade Junior College. Charles was married three times and was an associate editor for \"Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine.\" Three of Willeford's novels have been adapted into movies: Monte Hellman delivered a bleakly fascinating character study with \"Cockfighter\" (Charles wrote the script and has a sizable supporting role as the referee of a cockfighting tournament which climaxes the picture), George Armitage hit one out of the ballpark with the wonderfully quirky \"Miami Blues,\" and Robinson Devor scored a bull's eye with the offbeat \"The Woman Chaser.\" Charles popped up in a small part as a bartender in the fun redneck car chase romp \"Thunder and Lightning.\" Charles Willeford died of a heart attack at age 69 on March 27, 1988.",

He has published in excess (oh, wretched excess!) of 100 books, and no end of short stories.<br /><br />Born in Buffalo, N.Y., LB attended Antioch College, but left before completing his studies; school authorities advised him that they felt he\u2019d be happier elsewhere, and he thought this was remarkably perceptive of them.<br /><br />His earliest work, published pseudonymously in the late 1950s, was mostly in the field of midcentury erotica, an apprenticeship he shared with Donald E. Westlake and Robert Silverberg. The first time Lawrence Block\u2019s name appeared in print was when his short story \u201cYou Can\u2019t Lose\u201d was published in the February 1958 issue of Manhunt. The first book published under his own name was Mona (1961); it was reissued several times over the years, once as Sweet Slow Death. In 2005 it became the first offering from Hard Case Crime, and bore for the first time LB\u2019s original title, Grifter\u2019s Game.<br /><br />LB is best known for his series characters, including cop-turned-private investigator Matthew Scudder, gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, globe-trotting insomniac Evan Tanner, and introspective assassin Keller.<br /><br />Because one name is never enough, LB has also published under pseudonyms including Jill Emerson, John Warren Wells, Lesley Evans, and Anne Campbell Clarke.<br /><br />LB\u2019s magazine appearances include American Heritage, Redbook, Playboy, Linn\u2019s Stamp News, Cosmopolitan, GQ, and The New York Times. His monthly instructional column ran in Writer\u2019s Digest for 14 years, and led to a string of books for writers, including the classics Telling Lies for Fun &amp; Profit and The Liar\u2019s Bible. He has also written episodic television (Tilt!) and the Wong Kar-wai film, My Blueberry Nights.<br /><br />Several of LB\u2019s books have been filmed. The latest, A Walk Among the Tombstones, stars Liam Neeson as Matthew Scudder and is scheduled for release in September, 2014.<br /><br />LB is a Grand Master of Mystery Writers of America, and a past president of MWA and the Private Eye Writers of America. He has won the Edgar and Shamus awards four times each, and the Japanese Maltese Falcon award twice, as well as the Nero Wolfe and Philip Marlowe awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, and the Diamond Dagger for Life Achievement from the Crime Writers Association (UK). He\u2019s also been honored with the Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award from Mystery Ink magazine and the Edward D. Hoch Memorial Golden Derringer for Lifetime Achievement in the short story. In France, he has been proclaimed a Grand Maitre du Roman Noir and has twice been awarded the Societe 813 trophy. He has been a guest of honor at Bouchercon and at book fairs and mystery festivals in France, Germany, Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Taiwan. As if that were not enough, he was also presented with the key to the city of Muncie, Indiana. (But as soon as he left, they changed the locks.)<br /><br />LB and his wife Lynne are enthusiastic New Yorkers and relentless world travelers; the two are members of the Travelers Century Club, and have visited around 160 countries.<br /><br />He is a modest and humble fellow, although you would never guess as much from this biographical note.",

        "biography": "Born in the Ural Mountains of Russia, Vladimir Radunsky migrated to the United States in 1982, when he was still a relatively young man. Since then he has become well known for his brightly colored artwork and dynamic collages. Among the many children's books he has illustrated are the Candlewick Press titles HOWDI DO, BLING BLANG, and MY DOLLY, in which his vibrant images bring to life the nursery songs of folk-singing legend Woody Guthrie--tunes that appealed to him because they reminded him of songs he loved as a child growing up in Russia.<br /><br />In collaboration with fellow illustrator Chris Raschka, Vladimir Radunsky wrote and illustrated a rather unique collection of tongue-in-cheek advice on a very important topic: TABLE MANNERS. Through their alter egos Dudunya (Vladimir) and Chester (Chris), the pair share their considerable wisdom in a how-to guide to mealtime behavior. The artist moved on to explore the world of shapes in SQUARE TRIANGLE ROUND SKINNY, a boxed set of fun, funky board books featuring his brilliant graphics.<br /><br /><br />\"I don't pick the medium I work in, but rather it just happens,\" he says. \"And most of the elements I use are repeated in various combinations. Recently I came across a story by Hans Christian Andersen. In it, I found this thought that pretty closely resembles my work principle: 'Ah, godfather could really tell fairy tales--they were long and plentiful. And at Christmastime he would take a thick, blank album and paste in it pictures that he cut out of books and newspapers. When he could not find a picture that fitted the story, he would draw one.'\" <br /><br /><br />Vladimir Radunsky now lives in Rome, Italy.<br />",

Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.<br />As a child, <i>Jan Brett</i> decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, \"I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real.\" <br />As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. \"It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain,\" she says. \"I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting.\" <br />Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. \"From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books.\" <br />--from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.janbrett.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.janbrett.com</a>",

        "biography": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb was a British novelist, the eldest out of the three famous Bront\u00eb sisters whose novels have become standards of English literature. See also <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4191.Emily_Bront_\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emily Bront\u00eb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8249.Anne_Bront_\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anne Bront\u00eb</a>.<br /><br />Charlotte Bront\u00eb was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, England, the third of six children, to Patrick Bront\u00eb (formerly \"Patrick Brunty\"), an Irish Anglican clergyman, and his wife, Maria Branwell. In April 1820 the family moved a few miles to Haworth, a remote town on the Yorkshire moors, where Patrick had been appointed Perpetual Curate. This is where the Bront\u00eb children would spend most of their lives. Maria Branwell Bront\u00eb died from what was thought to be cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters and a son to the care of her spinster sister Elizabeth Branwell, who moved to Yorkshire to help the family.<br /><br />In August 1824 Charlotte, along with her sisters Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth, was sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire, a new school for the daughters of poor clergyman (which she would describe as Lowood School in Jane Eyre). The school was a horrific experience for the girls and conditions were appalling. They were regularly deprived of food, beaten by teachers and humiliated for the slightest error. The school was unheated and the pupils slept two to a bed for warmth. Seven pupils died in a typhus epidemic that swept the school and all four of the Bront\u00eb girls became very ill - Maria and Elizabeth dying of tuberculosis in 1825. Her experiences at the school deeply affected Bront\u00eb - her health never recovered and she immortalised the cruel and brutal treatment in her novel, <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Following the tragedy, their father withdrew his daughters from the school.<br /><br />At home in Haworth Parsonage, Charlotte and the other surviving children \u2014 Branwell, Emily, and Anne \u2014 continued their ad-hoc education. In 1826 her father returned home with a box of toy soldiers for Branwell. They would prove the catalyst for the sisters' extraordinary creative development as they immediately set to creating lives and characters for the soldiers, inventing a world for them which the siblings called 'Angria'. The siblings became addicted to writing, creating stories, poetry and plays. Bront\u00eb later said that the reason for this burst of creativity was that:<br /><br />'We were wholly dependent on ourselves and each other, on books and study, for the enjoyments and occupations of life. The highest stimulus, as well as the liveliest pleasure we had known from childhood upwards, lay in attempts at literary composition.'<br /><br />After her father began to suffer from a lung disorder, Charlotte was again sent to school to complete her education at Roe Head school in Mirfield from 1831 to 1832, where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents, Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor. During this period (1833), she wrote her novella The Green Dwarf under the name of Wellesley. The school was extremely small with only ten pupils meaning the top floor was completely unused and believed to be supposedly haunted by the ghost of a young lady dressed in silk. This story fascinated Bront\u00eb and inspired the figure of Mrs Rochester in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.<br /><br />Bront\u00eb left the school after a few years, however she swiftly returned in 1835 to take up a position as a teacher, and used her wages to pay for Emily and Anne to be taught at the school. However, teaching did not appeal to Bront\u00eb and in 1838 she left Roe Head to become a governess to the Sidgewick family - this was partly from a sense of adventure and a desire to see the world, and partly from financial necessity. <br /><br />Charlotte became pregnant soon after her wedding, but her health declined rapidly and, according to Gaskell, she was attacked by \"sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness.\" She died, with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, aged 38. .",

His books are potpourris of sexual description, quasi-philosophical speculation, reflection on literature and society, surrealistic imaginings, and autobiographical incident. <br /><br />After living in Paris in the 1930s, he returned to the United States and settled in Big Sur, California. Miller's first two works, <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> (Paris, 1934) and <i>Tropic of Capricorn</i> (Paris, 1939), were denied publication in the U.S. until the early 1960s because of alleged obscenity. <i>The Colossus of Maroussi</i> (1941), a travel book of modern Greece, is considered by some critics his best work. His other writings include the <i>Rosy Crucifixion Trilogy</i> \u2014 <i>Sexus</i> (1949), <i>Plexus</i> (1953), and <i>Nexus</i> (1960). In 1976 Norman Mailer edited a selection of Miller's writings, <i>Genius and Lust</i>. <br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Miller\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mi...</a>",

Goffman's other areas of study included social order and interaction, impression management, total institutions, social organization of experience, and stigmas. Some of the influences on his works include Durkheim, Freud, Mead, Radcliffe-Brown, and Simmel.<br /><br />In 2007 Goffman was listed as the 6th most-cited intellectual in the humanities and social sciences by The Times Higher Education Guide, behind Anthony Giddens and ahead of J\u00fcrgen Habermas.[1]. Goffman was also named the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association. Goffman is more cited today from his books than during his time. Writers today use his ideas to examine the relationship between individual behavior and the reproduction of social systems.<br />",

        "biography": "Henry James, OM, son of theologian Henry James Sr., brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author, one of the founders and leaders of a school of realism in fiction. He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death. He is primarily known for a series of major novels in which he portrayed the encounter of America with Europe. His plots centered on personal relationships, the proper exercise of power in such relationships, and other moral questions. His method of writing from the point of view of a character within a tale allowed him to explore the phenomena of consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting.<br />James insisted that writers in Great Britain and America should be allowed the greatest freedom possible in presenting their view of the world, as French authors were. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and unreliable narrators in his own novels and tales brought a new depth and interest to realistic fiction, and foreshadowed the modernist work of the twentieth century. An extraordinarily productive writer, in addition to his voluminous works of fiction he published articles and books of travel writing, biography, autobiography, and criticism,and wrote plays, some of which were performed during his lifetime with moderate success. His theatrical work is thought to have profoundly influenced his later novels and tales.",

        "biography": "<b>Marguerite Donnadieu</b>, better known as <b>Marguerite Duras</b> (pronounced [ma\u0280g\u0259\u0281it dy\u02c8\u0281as] in French) (April 4, 1914 \u2013 March 3, 1996) was a French writer and film director.<br /><br />She was born at Gia-Dinh, near Saigon, French Indochina (now Vietnam), after her parents responded to a campaign by the French government encouraging people to work in the colony.<br /><br />Marguerite's father fell ill soon after their arrival, and returned to France, where he died. After his death, her mother, a teacher, remained in Indochina with her three children. The family lived in relative poverty after a bad investment in an isolated property and area of farmland in Cambodia(t\u00eate de pisse). The difficult life that the family experienced during this period was highly influential on Marguerite's later work.<br /><br />At 17, Marguerite went to France, her parents' native country, where she began studying for a degree in mathematics. This she soon abandoned to concentrate on political sciences, and then law. After completing her studies, she became an active member of the PCF (the French Communist Party) and was engaged in the resistance.<br /><br />In 1943 she changed her surname to \"Duras\" for Duras, the name of a village in the Lot-et-Garonne d\u00e9partement, where her father's house was located.<br /><br />She is the author of a great many novels, plays, films, interviews and short narratives, including her best-selling, apparently autobiographical work L'Amant (1984), translated into English as The Lover. This text won the Goncourt prize in 1984. The story of her adolescence also appears in three other forms: The Sea Wall, Eden Cinema and The North China Lover. A film version of The Lover, produced by Claude Berri, was released to great success in 1992.<br /><br />Other major works include Moderato Cantabile, also made into a film of the same name, Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein, and her film India Song. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film Hiroshima mon amour, which was directed by Alain Resnais.<br /><br />Duras's early novels were fairly conventional in form (their 'romanticism' was criticised by fellow writer Raymond Queneau); however, with Moderato Cantabile she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the Nouveau roman French literary movement, although did not definitively belong to any group. Her films are also experimental in form, most eschewing synch sound, using voice over to allude to, rather than tell, a story over images whose relation to what is said may be more-or-less tangential.<br /><br />Marguerite's adult life was somewhat difficult, despite her success as a writer, and she was known for her periods of alcoholism. She died in Paris, aged 82 from throat cancer and is interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. Her tomb is marked simply 'MD'.<br /><br />From wikipedia",

In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero. <br />He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book <i>The Prophet</i>, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. <br />Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Lao-Tzu.",

        "biography": "Mary Ann Evans, known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She was born in 1819 at a farmstead in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, where her father was estate manager. Mary Ann, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good education for a young woman of her day. Influenced by a favorite governess, she became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. <br /><br />Her first published work was a religious poem. Through a family friend, she was exposed to Charles Hennell's \"An Inquiry into the Origins of Christianity\". Unable to believe, she conscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. Her father shunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister until she promised to reexamine her feelings. Her intellectual views did not, however, change. She translated \"Das Leben Jesu\", a monumental task, without signing her name to the 1846 work. <br /><br />After her father's death in 1849, Mary Ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with The Westminster Review. Despite a heavy workload, she translated \"The Essence of Christianity\", the only book ever published under her real name. That year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized British society by sending notices to friends announcing she had entered a free \"union\" with George Henry Lewes, editor of The Leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. They lived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social ostracism and financial hardship. She became salaried and began writing essays and reviews for The Westminster Review. <br /><br />Renaming herself \"Marian\" in private life and adopting the penname \"George Eliot,\" she began her impressive fiction career, including: \"Adam Bede\" (1859), \"The Mill on the Floss\" (1860), \"Silas Marner\" (1861), \"Romola\" (1863), and \"Middlemarch\" (1871). Themes included her humanist vision and strong heroines. Her poem, \"O May I Join the Choir Invisible\" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: \"O may I join the choir invisible/ Of those immortal dead who live again/ In minds made better by their presence. . .\" D. 1880.<br /><br />Her 1872 work Middlemarch has been described by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.<br /><br />More: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/eliot_george.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184688/George-Eliot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/t...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/authors/eliot/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/george-eliot-9286017\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biography.com/people/georg...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/deronda/ei_eliot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/d...</a>",

        "biography": "Gabriel Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia Garc\u00ed\u00ada M\u00e1rquez was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist. Garc\u00ed\u00ada M\u00e1rquez, familiarly known as \"Gabo\" in his native country, was considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />He studied at the University of Bogot\u00e1 and later worked as a reporter for the Colombian newspaper <i>El Espectador</i> and as a foreign correspondent in Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Caracas and New York. He wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (1967) and <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in order to explain real experiences. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude.<br /><br />Having previously written shorter fiction and screenplays, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sequestered himself away in his Mexico City home for an extended period of time to complete his novel <i>Cien a\u00f1os de soledad</i>, or <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, published in 1967. The author drew international acclaim for the work, which ultimately sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is credited with helping introduce an array of readers to magical realism, a genre that combines more conventional storytelling forms with vivid, layered fantasy.<br /><br />Another one of his novels, <i>El amor</i> en <i>los tiempos del c\u00f3lera</i> (1985), or <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, drew a large global audience as well. The work was partially based on his parents' courtship and was adapted into a 2007 film starring Javier Bardem. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote seven novels during his life, with additional titles including <i>El general en su laberinto (1989)</i>, or <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>, and <i>Del amor y otros demonios (1994)</i>, or <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i>.<br /><br />(Arabic: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5029628._\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632</a>) (Hebrew: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7091051._\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d2\u05d0\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05e8\u05e7\u05e1</a>)",

        "biography": "Theodor Seuss Geisel was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, MA. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vaction in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During WW II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published The Cat in the Hat, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was Green Eggs and Ham. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name:<br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/398177.Theo_Le_Sieg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theo Le Sieg</a>",

Woods is a Professor of Iranian and Central Asian History in the Departments of History and of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and the College at the University of Chicago. John Woods received his B.A. from the University of Texas, where he was among the first to receive Title VI funding for the study of Arabic. In 1960, he was also among the first to receive a Fulbright fellowship for the Arabic study, traveling to Cairo to learn Arabic. After a period of study in the University of Tehran, he completed his doctorate in Iranian history from Princeton University in 1974 under the supervision of Martin B. Dickson. In 1970 he first came to teach at University of Chicago, and quickly distinguished himself as a leading scholar of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. Professor Woods focuses primarily on the history of Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia from the 13th to 18th century. He is particularly interested in aspects of the encounter of sedentary and nomadic people in those regions during that time period. He is at present working on several projects dealing with the age of Chinggis Khan and Timur (Tamerlane). He has played a central role in the Center for Middle Eastern Studies since 1980, serving four terms as director. He has won recognition for excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching at Chicago and is a recipient of the Farabi International Award for contributions in Iranian and Islamic studies.",

        "biography": "Today, almost every perfume is created from synthetic essences. Although synthetics approximate the odors of natural ingredients, they have none of the complexity, mystery or emotional depth. We bring an inexplicable emotional intensity to the experience of an authentic smell and the memories it sparks and creates. <br /><br />My approach to creating artisan natural perfumes is based in the quality and integrity of the ingredients. I hand blend each perfume from my collection of extraordinary essences, which I have gathered with uncompromising standards for only the finest quality 100% pure and natural materials. I seek out exotic, unusual essences from hidden corners of the world, often smelling a dozen versions of the same oil, searching for the one that surpasses the rest. Finding the essences is like a quest, and I enjoy it as much as the act of creation. Through years of searching I have amassed a comprehensive and strikingly beautiful palette from which to work. <br /><br />In each perfume, I try to capture a feeling and aesthetic experience. I start with a concept for the perfume, and work to create something modern and luxurious. With some perfumes, the first iteration is almost perfect. Others take endless revisions and weeks of blending until everything comes together in the ideal balance. <br /><br />Once the formulas are developed, I hand blend small batches of perfume, and bottle it in the same studio it was created in. I am connected to the whole process, and it makes me very happy when people incorporate my perfumes in their lives. It is my hope that people have a feeling of luxury, well-being, beauty and excitement when they wear Aftelier Perfumes. <br /><br />In addition to my work as a perfumer, I am the author of six books, three of which are on natural perfume. <i>Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume</i> has been translated into seven languages and was the winner of The Sense of Smell Institute's Richard B. Solomon Award. <i>Aroma</i>, a cookbook (co-authored with chef Daniel Patterson), focuses on the essential link between food and fragrance and includes recipes for both. <i>Scents &amp; Sensibilities</i> guides the reader through the history and creation of solid perfumes. <br /><br />My three other books are <i>The Story of Your Life: Becoming the Author of Your Experience</i>, <i>When Talk is Not Cheap</i> and <i>Death of a Rolling Stone: The Brian Jones Story</i>. <br /><br />In early 2009, Living Perfume: The Natural Alchemy of Mandy Aftel, debuted at the Fifth Avenue store, Henri Bendel. The exhibit focused on education and the history of perfumery. It showcased my perfumes as well as my extraordinary collection of perfume memorabilia. The event was commemorated in a catalogue, which can be viewed here. <br /><br />As the curator for an exhibition on the history of natural perfume The Foul and the Fragrant: Creating Natural Perfume at the Doheny Memorial Library, University of Southern California I displayed turn-of-the-century perfume books and vintage memorabilia from my private collection. My artistry with natural perfumery was the subject of the exhibit, Constructing Perfume: Scent, Space, Color at 3A Gallery in San Francisco, which included architectural renderings of my fragrances, and an interactive experience of viewers matching color chips to scents. <br /><br />In 2004, I was invited to create a perfume for a 2000 year old child mummy in conjunction with the Stanford Medical Center, the Rosicrucian Museum and Silicon Graphics (SGI). <br /><br />In addition to my work with Michelin-starred chef Daniel Patterson (Coi Restaurant), I have worked with Daniel Barber (Blue Hill, Blue Hill at Stone Barns), Johnny Iuzinni (Jean Georges), and other chefs. I have conducted classes and demonstrations for vintners and sommeliers, and at the University of Southern California, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Ideo, Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, Apple, Clif Bar, the James Beard Foundation, New York University, Slow Food, London Design Festival, Esalen Ins",

        "biography": "Before a dramatic mid-life course correction while in Japan, young Michael Justin Sullivan had been a sailing captain, delivering yachts from the Northeast to Fort Lauderdale, the Bahamas and beyond into the Caribbean. These were the last days of canvas sail, teak decks and navigating by sextant, a time in the \u201850s and \u201860s when Ft. Lauderdale was still a sleepy Florida city and there were but a few paved roads on the Out Islands.<br /><br />This is the era captured by Three-Strand Cordage, a novel of one man\u2019s life in three interwoven tales. Against the tranquil background of this vanished era, he finds himself caught up in kidnapping and a murderous shootout, deceived and betrayed in a gun-smuggling plot by anti-Castro Cubans, and fleeing from drug smugglers with his daughter, only to sail into Hurricane Agnes.<br />In his mid-30s, M.J. Sullivan became a champion Japanese swordsman. As Seiho his calligraphy has twice won the Kamp\u014d Prize, as well as the prestigious Nippon Shuji Prize.<br /><br />His novel, In This Living Body, is twinned with his Shingy\u014d: Reflections on Translating the Heart Sutra, both now available on Amazon.<br /><br />With a Masters in Asian Studies, three of his calligraphy workbooks have been published in Japan. His classic book on Japanese swordsmanship, Sword and Psyche, led to WAZA, his first novel about Japanese Buddhism and the martial arts, which received the CoVisions Recognition Award for Literature in 1994.<br /><br />Now primarily a literary author, he still teaches the Zen of swordsmanship and custom brushes calligraphy for clients and collectors from his studio in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.<br />",

Injury forced him out of the final match at the Oval and prevented him from playing Test cricket again.

He is the author of almost a dozen books that explore the boundaries of hard-nosed, practical business strategy and satire. These include Crazy Bosses, which, in mapping the relationship between pathology and power, predicted so much of the current political climate; What Would Machiavelli Do, which addressed why mean people often do better than nice ones; and most recently a comprehensive replacement for the traditional MBA program, The Curriculum. His three novels are Lloyd: What Happened, You Look Nice Today, and Immortal Life.",

After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known today: <i>V.</i> (1963), <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> (1966), <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> (1973), <i>Vineland</i> (1990), <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> (1997), and <i>Against the Day</i> (2006).<br /><br />Pynchon is regarded by many readers and critics as one of the finest contemporary authors. He is a MacArthur Fellow and a recipient of the National Book Award, and is regularly cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Both his fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, styles, and themes, including (but not limited to) the fields of history, science and mathematics. Pynchon is also known for his avoidance of personal publicity: very few photographs of him have ever been published, and rumours about his location and identity have been circulated since the 1960's.<br />",

In 1963 he returned to America and married Mimi Baez, sister of Joan, and they became a folk duo. Their debut album was recommended by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the ten best releases of 1965.<br />Farina was killed in a motorbike accident, just two days after his book <i>Been Down so Long It Looks Like Up to Me</i> had been published.",

Tainter argues that sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions[3] and that societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their \"energy subsidies\" reach a point of diminishing marginal returns.

        "biography": "Nikola Tesla was a genius polymath, inventor and a mechanical and electrical engineer. He is frequently cited as one of the most important contributors to the birth of commercial electricity, a man who \"shed light over the face of Earth,\" and is best known for his many revolutionary developments in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tesla's patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current (AC) electric power systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />Born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, Vojna Krajina, in the territory of today's Croatia, he was a subject of the Austrian Empire by birth and later became an American citizen. After his demonstration of wireless communication (radio) in 1894 and after being the victor in the \"War of Currents\", he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in America. Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. During this period, in the United States, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist in history or popular culture, but due to his eccentric personality and his seemingly unbelievable and sometimes bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological developments, Tesla was ultimately ostracized and regarded as a mad scientist. Never having put much focus on his finances, Tesla died impoverished at the age of 86.<br /><br />The SI unit measuring magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic field \"B\"), the tesla, was named in his honor (at the <i>Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures</i>, Paris, 1960), as well as the Tesla effect of wireless energy transfer to wirelessly power electronic devices which Tesla demonstrated on a low scale (lightbulbs) as early as 1893 and aspired to use for the intercontinental transmission of industrial energy levels in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.<br /><br />Aside from his work on electromagnetism and electromechanical engineering, Tesla contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of robotics, remote control, radar and computer science, and to the expansion of ballistics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States credited him as being the inventor of the radio. Many of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and early New Age occultism.<br />",

His works often cover such subjects as pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, the Knights Templar, lost cities and vimana aircraft. Despite his public involvement in the general field of study, Childress claims to have no academic credentials as a professional archaeologist.<br /><br />Born in France, and raised in Colorado, Childress began his world travels at age nineteen in pursuit of his archaeological interests. In 1983 Childress relocated to Stelle, Illinois, a community founded by New Age writer Richard Kieninger, after Childress was given a book authored by Kieninger while touring Africa. Childress chronicled his explorations in his Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries series of books, whose core concepts were influenced by the ideas of Kieninger.<br /><br />While residing in Stelle, Childress began self publishing his own works and later other authors, which focus on presenting fringe scientific theories regarding ancient civilizations and little-known technologies, as well as establishing a travel business in partnership with Kieninger. In 1991, in the nearby town of Kempton, Illinois, Childress, along with historian and linguist Carl W. Hart, founded the World Explorers Club, a group that often travels to the places he writes about, and an affiliated magazine, World Explorer.<br /><br />David Hatcher Childress has appeared on several television programs on NBC (\"The Mysterious Origins of Man\"), Fox Network (Sightings and Encounters), Discovery Channel, A&amp;E, The History Channel, as a commentator on subjects such as the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and UFOs.<br /><br />Childress has been involved in two lawsuits regarding his publishing activities, one of which failed due to the expiry of a statute of limitations and the other, involving his company's publication of a master's thesis without permission, which was settled out of court.<br /> from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hatcher_Childress\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ha...</a>",

A four-time RWA RITA Award nominee, eleven-time Romantic Times Award nominee and 2006 RT Award winner, Leslie has become known for her delightful characters, sparkling dialogue, and outrageous humor in her romances, and for the dark grittiness of her thrillers. Since the publication of her first book in 1999, Leslie has gone on to pen more than forty sassy, sexy romances for Harlequin Temptation, Blaze, and HQN.<br /><br />In 2009, Leslie began tapping into her love for dark suspense by penning several books under the pseudonym Leslie Parrish. The Black CATs and Extrasensory Agents series quickly put Leslie on the must-read list of romantic-suspense fans. <br /><br />Tired of writing under various names, Leslie decided to go into her next genre--futuristic thrillers with a suspense element--under her real name. She released her dark, gritty Veronica Sloan books, and reissued the Black CATs series, as Leslie A. Kelly. <br /><br />Leslie lives in New Mexico with her husband Bruce--her real-life romance hero--and two spoiled-rotten dogs.

From sexy to thrilling, sweet to humorous, I like them all. But what I really love is writing romance--the hotter the better!<br /><br />I started my first novel back in high school and have been writing ever since. To date, I've published over thirty novels, one of them a prestigious RITA Award nominee, Romance Writers of America's highest award of excellence. I have also been nominated by Romantic Times magazine for several Reviewer's Choice awards, as well as a career achievement award.<br /><br />I've written for several different publishers, including Harlequin Books, Leisure Books, Berkley/Jove, St. Martin's Press and Warner Books. Born and bred in the Lone Start State, I still live deep in the heart with my real-life hero, Curt, and our young children.<br /><br />Like any over-worked, under-appreciated wife and mother, I have very little free time. But when I find a few precious moments, I LOVE to read. Some of my favorite authors include Janet Evanovich, Vicki Lewis Thompson, Charlaine Harris (see my Favorite Reads page for more) and the exceptionally talented Nina Bangs. Give me a bag of Sugar Babies, a Toby Keith or Kevin Fowler CD (I love Texas music), and a great book, and I'm in heaven!",

Golding spent two years in Oxford focusing on sciences; however, he changed his educational emphasis to English literature, especially Anglo-Saxon.<br /><br />During World War II, he was part of the Royal Navy which he left five years later. His bellic experience strongly influenced his future novels. Later, he became a teacher and focused on writing. Some of his influences are classical Greek literature, such as Euripides, and <i>The Battle of Maldon</i>, an Anglo-Saxon oeuvre whose author is unknown.<br /><br />The attention given to <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, Golding's first novel, by college students in the 1950s and 1960s drove literary critics' attention to it. He was awarded the Booker Prize for literature in 1980 for his novel <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14431.Rites_of_Passage\" title=\"Rites of Passage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rites of Passage</a>, the first book of the trilogy <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/58734-to-the-ends-of-the-earth\" rel=\"nofollow\">To the Ends of the Earth</a>.

        "biography": "After 15 years of concentrating exclusively on painting Nick Jolly embarked on a haphazard writing career in tandem with his pursuits as an artist. This initially took the form of articles penned for the Art Review. Then in 1999 he co-founded The Chap magazine, under the alter ego of Vic Darkwood, with his erstwhile colleague Gustav Temple. During this time, as well as producing a quarterly magazine, they also wrote 3 spin-off Chap books.<br /><br />At the end of 2003 Vic Darkwood left The Chap, as he felt that his work on that periodical was done. At the time he cited 'artistic differences' and 'a pronounced fatigue at superimposing yet more pipes onto vintage photographs of gentlemen' as his reasons for leaving, but an urge to dedicate himself more fully to the studio was the real motivation.Despite these best resolve, in 2005 he collaborated once more with Gustav Temple to construct a final Chap tome and then in 2006 wrote his first solo book The Lost Art of Travel (published in the U.S. under the title: How to Make Friends and Oppress People)<br /><br />For the past four yeares Jolly has spent most of his time working on the development of his paintings. An exhibition of these will be held at 108 Fine Art in 2009.",

        "biography": "Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.<br /><br />Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.<br /><br />Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.<br />",

Parker</a>.</i><br /><b>Robert Brown Parker</b> was an American crime writer. His most famous works were the novels about the private detective Spenser. ABC television network developed the television series <i>Spenser: For Hire</i> based on the character in the late 1980s; a series of TV movies based on the character were also produced. His works incorporate encyclopedic knowledge of the Boston metropolitan area. Parker was 77 when he died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts; discovered at his desk by his wife Joan, he had been working on a novel. The Spenser novels have been cited by critics and bestselling authors such as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8944.Robert_Crais\" title=\"Robert Crais\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Crais</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/24689.Harlan_Coben\" title=\"Harlan Coben\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harlan Coben</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10289.Dennis_Lehane\" title=\"Dennis Lehane\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dennis Lehane</a> as not only influencing their own work but reviving and changing the detective genre.<br />Robert B. Parker was one of contemporary fiction's most popular and respected detective writers. Best known for his portrayal of the tough but erudite investigator Spenser, Parker wrote over twenty-five novels over the course of his career, which began in 1973. Parker's acclaim and his thorough background in classic detective literature helped earn him the somewhat unusual commission of completing a Philip Marlowe novel that the great Raymond Chandler had left unfinished. <br /><br />Promised Land and the other Spenser novels spawned the movie Spenser: For Hire and a string of made-for-TV movies.",

Years ago, I was thinking about Virginia Woolf\u2019s question: what if Shakespeare had had an equally talented sister? <br />Woolf\u2019s answer: She died without writing a word.<br />What, I wondered, would it take for a woman of that era, with that kind of capacious intelligence, not to die without writing a word?<br />For one thing, she\u2019d have to be a genius at breaking rules.<br />My novel The Weight of Ink reaches back in time to ask the question: what does it take for a woman not to be defeated when everything around her is telling her to sit down and mind her manners? I started writing with two characters in mind, both women who don\u2019t mind their manners: a contemporary historian named Helen Watt and a seventeenth century Inquisition refugee named Ester Velasquez. It\u2019s been a delight working on their story. <br />The Weight of Ink is my third novel, but I\u2019ve also written two other novels and one novella, plus a few dozen essays and stories. Whether I\u2019m writing fiction or nonfiction, I put words to paper because it's my way of metabolizing life. To paraphrase Henry James: I don't really know what I think until I see what I say. <br />Thanks for visiting this page, and for your interest in books.<br />",

        "biography": "Alisa Rosenbaum was born in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg to a prosperous Jewish family. When the Bolsheviks requisitioned the pharmacy owned by her father, Fronz, the Rosenbaums fled to the Crimea. Alisa returned to the city (renamed Leningrad) to attend the university, but in 1926 relatives who had already settled in America offered her the chance of joining them there. With money from the sale of her mother's jewelry, Alisa bought a ticket to New York. On arrival at Ellis Island, she changed into Ayn (after a name of some Finnish author, probably \"Aino\") Rand (which she said was an abbreviation of her Russian surname). She moved swiftly to Hollywood, where she learned English, worked in the RKO wardrobe department and as an extra, and wrote through the night on screenplays and novels. She also married a bit-part actor called Frank O'Connor because he was 'beautiful' - and because her original visitor's visa had run out.<br />Rand sold her first screenplay in 1932, but nobody would buy her first novel <i>We the Living</i> (1936) a melodrama set in Russia. Her first real success was <i>The Fountainhead</i> (rejected by more than ten publishers before publication in 1943).<br />She started a new philosophy known as Objectivism, opposed to state interference of all kinds, and her follow-up novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) describes a group who attempt to escape America's conspiracy of mediocrity. Objectivism has been an influence on various other movements such as Libertarianism, and Rand's vocal support for Laissez-faire Capitalism and the free market has earned her a distinct spot among American philosophers, and philosophers in general.<br /><br />---<br />",

He currently works as a private advisor, making speeches and providing consulting for firms through his company, Greenspan Associates LLC.<br /><br />First appointed Fed chairman by President Ronald Reagan in August 1987, he was reappointed at successive four-year intervals until retiring after a record-setting tenure on January 31, 2006, at which time he relinquished the chairmanship to Ben Bernanke. Greenspan was lauded for his handling of the Black Monday stock market crash that occurred very shortly after he first became chairman, as well as for his stewardship of the Internet-driven, \"dot-com\" economic boom of the 1990s.[citation needed] This expansion culminated in a stock market bubble burst in March 2000 followed by a recession beginning in late 2000 and continuing through 2002.<br /><br />From 2001 until his retirement from the Fed, he was increasingly criticized for some statements seen as overstepping the Fed's traditional purview of monetary policy, and viewed by others as overly supportive of the policies of President George W. Bush, as well as for policies seen by Business Week Magazine and others as leading to a housing bubble. During his tenure Greenspan was considered to be the leading authority on American domestic economic and monetary policy, and his active influence continues to this day.<br />",

Although his existence remains uncertain and (if they ever existed) no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.<br /><br />Scattered details of Aesop's life can be found in ancient sources, including <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2192.Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aristotle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/901.Herodotus\" title=\"Herodotus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herodotus</a>, and Plutarch. An ancient literary work called The Aesop Romance tells an episodic, probably highly fictional version of his life, including the traditional description of him as a strikingly ugly slave (\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) who by his cleverness acquires freedom and becomes an adviser to kings and city-states. Older spellings of his name have included Esop(e) and Isope. A later tradition (dating from the Middle Ages) depicts Aesop as a black Ethiopian. Depictions of Aesop in popular culture over the last 2500 years have included several works of art and his appearance as a character in numerous books, films, plays, and television programs.<br /><br />Abandoning the perennial image of Aesop as an ugly slave, the movie Night in Paradise (1946) cast Turhan Bey in the role, depicting Aesop as an advisor to King Croesus who falls in love with the king's intended bride, a Persian princess played by Merle Oberon. There was also the 1953 teleplay Aesop and Rhodope by Helene Hanff, broadcast on Hallmark Hall of Fame with Lamont Johnson playing Aesop.<br /><br />A raposa e as uvas (\"The Fox and the Grapes\"), a play in three acts about the life of Aesop by Brazilian dramatist Guilherme Figueiredo, was published in 1953 and has been performed in many countries, including a videotaped production in China in 2000 under the title Hu li yu pu tao or \u72d0\u72f8\u4e0e\u8461\u8404.<br /><br />Beginning in 1959, animated shorts under the title Aesop and Son appeared as a recurring segment in the TV series Rocky and His Friends and its successor, The Bullwinkle Show. The image of Aesop as ugly slave was abandoned; Aesop (voiced by Charles Ruggles), a Greek citizen, would recount a fable for the edification of his son, Aesop Jr., who would then deliver the moral in the form of an atrocious pun. Aesop's 1998 appearance in the episode \"Hercules and the Kids\" in the animated TV series Hercules (voiced by Robert Keeshan) amounted to little more than a cameo.<br /><br />In 1971, Bill Cosby played Aesop in the TV production Aesop's Fables.<br /><br />The musical Aesop's Fables by British playwright Peter Terson was first produced in 1983. In 2010, the play was staged at the Fugard Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa with Mhlekahi Mosiea as Aesop.",

Several of his books, including Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About, allege that both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the pharmaceutical industry value profit over treatments or cures.<br /><br />Trudeau's activities have been the subject of both criminal and civil action. He was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud in the early 1990s, and in 1998 he was sued by U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for making false or misleading claims in infomercials promoting his book The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About. In 2004, he settled that action, by agreeing to pay a $500,000 fine and consenting to a lifetime ban on promoting products other than his books via infomercials. On Nov. 29, 2011, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a $37.6 million fine levied against him for violating that 2004 settlement.

        "biography": "Alexis-Charles-Henri Cl\u00e9rel de Tocqueville (July 29, 1805 \u2013 April 16, 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these works, he explored the effects of the rising equality of social conditions on the individual and the state in western societies.<br /><br />Democracy in America (1835), his major work, published after his travels in the United States, is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. An eminent representative of the classical liberal political tradition, Tocqueville was an active participant in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848) and then during the Second Republic (1849\u20131851) which succeeded to the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's December 2, 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution, Volume I. After obtaining a law degree, Alexis de Tocqueville was named auditor-magistrate at the court of Versailles. There, he met Gustave de Beaumont, a prosecutor substitute, who collaborated with him on various literary works. Both were sent to the United States to study the penitentiary system. During this trip, they wrote Du syst\u00e8me p\u00e9nitentiaire aux Etats-Unis et de son application (1832). Back in France, Tocqueville became a lawyer. He met the English economist Nassau William Senior in 1833, and they became good friends and corresponded for many years.[1] He published his master-work, De la d\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique, in 1835. The success of this work, an early model for the science that would become known as sociology, led him to be named chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) in 1837, and to be elected the next year to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques. In 1841 he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.<br /><br />Tocqueville, who despised the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848), began his political career in the same period. Thus, he became deputy of the Manche department (Valognes), a position which he maintained until 1851. In parliament, he defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade, while supporting the colonization of Algeria carried on by Louis-Philippe's regime. Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of the Manche in 1842, and became the president of the department's conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral between 1849 and 1851.<br /><br />Apart from Canada, Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England, producing Memoir on Pauperism. In 1841 and 1846, he traveled to Algeria. His first travel inspired his Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, in which he criticized the French model of colonization, based on an assimilationist view, preferring instead the British model of indirect rule, which did not mix different populations together. He went as far as openly advocating racial segregation between the European colonists and the \"Arabs\" through the implementation of two different legislative systems (a half century before its effective implementation with the 1881 Indigenous code).<br /><br />After the fall of the July Monarchy during the February 1848 Revolution, Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, where he became a member of the Commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the Second Republic (1848\u20131851). He defended bicameralism (two parliamentary chambers) and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the laboring population of Paris, universal suffrage was conceived as a means to block the revolutionary spirit of Paris.<br /><br />During the Second Republic, Tocqueville sided with the parti de l'Ordre against the \"socialists\" and workers. A few days after the February insurrection, he believed a violent clash between the workers' population agitating in favor of a \"Democratic and Social Republic\" and",

He went on to host his own show on MTV, called <i>The Jon Stewart Show</i>, and then hosted another show on MTV called You Wrote It, You Watch It.<br /><br />Stewart became the host of <i>The Daily Show</i> on Comedy Central in early 1999. He is also a writer and co-producer of the show. After Stewart joined, <i>The Daily Show</i> steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim leading to his first Emmy Award in 2001. Stewart himself has also gained significant notoriety as a vocal, outspoken critic of the Bush administration and of personality-driven media shows, in particular Bill O'Reilly and the Fox News Channel. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his \"mock news\" desk. However the validity of this distinction is challenged by a number of critics, researchers, and even supporters, some of whom have awarded <i>The Daily Show</i> with news and journalism awards.<br /><br />Stewart co-wrote <i>America (The Book)</i>, which was one of the top fifteen best-sellers in the US in 2004.

Several of his plays continue to be widely performed, especially <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>. <br /><br />As the result of a widely covered series of trials, Wilde suffered a dramatic downfall and was imprisoned for two years hard labour after being convicted of \"gross indecency\" with other men. After Wilde was released from prison he set sail for Dieppe by the night ferry. He never returned to Ireland or Britain, and died in poverty.",

Hsing Yun is a forty-eighth generation lineage holder of the Linji Chan (Rinzai Zen) school through Master Zhi Kai, his teacher. He served as the first, second and third term director and abbot of the order before voluntarily resigning his position in 1985 in favor of his disciple, Hsin Ping.<br /><br />Hsing Yun is known for his \"Humanistic Buddhism\" philosophy employed by the Fo Guang Shan order, which utilizes Buddhism to fit the needs of a modern world. He is credited by Buddhist scholars as one of the forefront leaders in modern reformation of Buddhism by opening monasteries, universities and schools around the world, as well as engaging in religious dialogue amongst other Buddhist sects and religious faiths.<br /><br />In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is notable for his activity in political affairs, particularly on the One China Policy as well as government legislation supported by the Kuomintang, and is often criticized for his views by those in favor of Taiwanese independence, conservative Buddhists and religious figures. He was a figure of interest during the 1996 United States finance scandal involving then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore and a visit to Hsi Lai Temple, the U.S. branch of Hsing Yun's organization",

Born in 1901 to a Chinese merchant family in Rajburi, a town to the west of Bangkok, she was the eldest of five children \u2014 or, counting her father's children by a second wife, the eldest of eight. Her mother was a very religious woman and taught her the rudiments of Buddhist practice, such as nightly chants and the observance of the precepts, from an early age. In later life she described how, at the age of six, she became so filled with fear and loathing at the miseries her mother went through in being pregnant and giving birth to a younger sibling that, on seeing the newborn child for the first time \u2014 \"sleeping quietly, a little red thing with black, black hair\" \u2014 she ran away from home for three days. This experience, plus the anguish she must have felt when her parents separated, probably lay behind her decision, made when she was still quite young, never to submit to what she saw as the slavery of marriage.<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/kee/dynamic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/th...</a><br /><br />",

        "biography": "Steve McCurry, recognized universally as one of today\u2019s finest image-makers, has won many of photography\u2019s top awards. Best known for his evocative color photography, McCurry, in the finest documentary tradition, captures the essence of human struggle and joy. Member of Magnum Photos since 1986, McCurry has searched and found the unforgettable; many of his images have become modern icons. Born in Philadelphia, McCurry graduated cum laude from the College of Arts and Architecture at the Pennsylvania State University. After working at a newspaper for two years, he left for India to freelance. It was in India that McCurry learned to watch and wait on life. \u201cIf you wait,\u201d he realized, \u201cpeople will forget your camera and the soul will drift up into view.\u201d<br /><br />His career was launched when, disguised in native garb, he crossed the Pakistan border into rebel-controlled Afghanistan just before the Russian invasion. When he emerged, he had rolls of film sewn into his clothes of images that would be published around the world as among the first to show the conflict there. His coverage won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad, an award dedicated to photographers exhibiting exceptional courage and enterprise. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including Magazine Photographer of the Year, awarded by the National Press Photographers\u2019 Association. That was the same year in which he won an unprecedented four first prizes in the World Press Photo Contest. He has won the Olivier Rebbot Memorial Award twice.<br /><br />Steve McCurry has covered many areas of international and civil conflict, including the Iran-Iraq war, the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, Beirut, Cambodia, the Philippines, the Gulf War, and continuing coverage of Afghanistan. He focuses on the human consequences of war, not only showing what war impresses on the landscape, but rather, on the human face. <br /><br />McCurry\u2019s work has been featured in every major magazine in the world and frequently appears in National Geographic magazine with recent articles on the Hazaras of Afghanistan, Buddhism, Tibet, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and the temples of Angkor Wat, Cambodia. McCurry is driven by an innate curiosity and sense of wonder about the world and everyone in it. He has an uncanny ability to cross boundaries of language and culture to capture stories of human experience. \u201cMost of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape that you could call the human condition.\u201d <br /><br />A high point in his career was the rediscovery of the previously unidentified Afghan refugee girl that many have described as the most recognizable photograph in the world today. When McCurry finally located Sharbat Gula after almost two decades, he said, \u201cHer skin is weathered; there are wrinkles now, but she is a striking as she was all those years ago.\u201d McCurry returned from an extended assignment in China on September 10, 2001. His coverage at Ground Zero on September 11 is a testament to the heroism and nobility of the people of New York City. \u201cYou felt the horror and immediately, instinctively understood that our lives would never be the same again.\u201d<br /><br />McCurry has published many books including, In the Shadows of Mountains (2007), Looking East (2006), Steve McCurry (2005), The Path to Buddha: A Tibetan Pilgrimage (2003), Sanctuary (2002), South Southeast (2000), Portraits (1999), Monsoon (1988), The Imperial Way (1985).<br />",

Born in New Jersey, she studied music at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and worked for some time as a pianist and piano teacher. She married and raised a family of four children, then separated from her husband and worked as a teacher, secretary, and assistant in a university department. She began Zen practice in her 40s with Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi in Los Angeles, and later with Hakuun Yasutani and Soen Nakagawa. Having received Dharma transmission from Taizan Maezumi Roshi, she opened the Zen Center San Diego in 1983, serving as its head teacher until July 2006.<br />Beck was responsible for a number of important innovations in Zen teaching. In particular, she taught students to work with the emotions of everyday life rather than attempting to avoid or escape them. Because she was adept at teaching students to work with their psychological states, she attracted a number of students who were interested in the relationship between Zen and modern psychology. Several of her Dharma heirs are practicing psychologists/psychiatrists. In 1995 Joko, along with three of her Dharma heirs, founded the Ordinary Mind Zen School.<br />Shortly after Beck\u2019s departure in 2006, she revoked Dharma transmission from two senior students: Ezra Bayda and Elizabeth Hamilton. Beck also stated that Zen Center San Diego should not claim to represent her or her teaching. In 2006 Joko moved to Prescott, Arizona, where she continued to teach until she retired as a teacher in late 2010. In the spring of 2010, Joko announced Gary Nafstad as her last Dharma successor",

        "biography": "<b>Mary Shelley</b> (n\u00e9e Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, often known as <i>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</i>) was a British novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, travel writer, and editor of the works of her husband, Romantic poet and philosopher <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45882\" rel=\"nofollow\">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. She was the daughter of the political philosopher <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/113910\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Godwin</a> and the writer, philosopher, and feminist <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1853305\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>.<br /><br />Mary Shelley was taken seriously as a writer in her own lifetime, though reviewers often missed the political edge to her novels. After her death, however, she was chiefly remembered only as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley and as the author of <i>Frankenstein</i>. It was not until 1989, when Emily Sunstein published her prizewinning biography <i>Mary Shelley: Romance and Reality</i>, that a full-length scholarly biography analyzing all of Shelley's letters, journals, and works within their historical context was published.<br /><br />The well-meaning attempts of Mary Shelley's son and daughter-in-law to \"Victorianise\" her memory through the censoring of letters and biographical material contributed to a perception of Mary Shelley as a more conventional, less reformist figure than her works suggest. Her own timid omissions from Percy Shelley's works and her quiet avoidance of public controversy in the later years of her life added to this impression. <br /><br />The eclipse of Mary Shelley's reputation as a novelist and biographer meant that, until the last thirty years, most of her works remained out of print, obstructing a larger view of her achievement. She was seen as a one-novel author, if that. In recent decades, however, the republication of almost all her writings has stimulated a new recognition of its value. Her voracious reading habits and intensive study, revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works, is now better appreciated. Shelley's recognition of herself as an author has also been recognized; after Percy's death, she wrote about her authorial ambitions: \"I think that I can maintain myself, and there is something inspiriting in the idea\". Scholars now consider Mary Shelley to be a major Romantic figure, significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal.",

In March 1998, while reading the apostolic fathers and subsequent church history in preparation for a Wednesday evening bible study, Alex Jones discovered the Catholic Church to be charismatic/liturgical, hierarchical, and Eucharistic-centered. In light of that revelation, Alex and his wife Donna began a two year journey into the Catholic Church that culminated in fifty-four members of his previous congregation, including fourteen members of his own family, entering the Catholic Church. The group began R.C.I.A. at St. Suzanne Catholic Community on September 10, 2000 and were welcomed into the Catholic Church through confirmation during Easter Vigil on April 14, 2001. Alex Jones was subsequently ordained a Permanent Deacon in the Archdiocese of Detroit on October 1, 2005. Deacon Jones received his Masters in Pastoral Studies from Sacred Heart Major Seminary on April 28, 2007 and retired from the position of evangelization coordinator for the Archdiocese of Detroit on May 31, 2007. Deacon Jones currently serves the three parishes of St. Suzanne/OLGH, St. Mary of Redford, and St. Thomas Aquinas. He and his wife Donna have three sons and ten grandchildren.",

        "biography": "The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO was born in 1947 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Before dedicating his life completely to literature, he worked as theatre director and actor, lyricist and journalist. In 1986, PAULO COELHO did the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella, an experience later to be documented in his book The Pilgrimage. In the following year, COELHO published The Alchemist. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time. Other titles include Brida (1990), The Valkyries (1992), By the river Piedra I sat Down and Wept (1994), the collection of his best columns published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo entitle Maktub (1994), the compilation of texts Phrases (1995), The Fifth Mountain (1996), Manual of a Warrior of Light (1997), Veronika decides to die (1998), The Devil and Miss Prym (2000), the compilation of traditional tales in Stories for parents, children and grandchildren (2001), Eleven Minutes (2003), The Zahir (2005), The Witch of Portobello (2006) and Winner Stands Alone (to be released in 2009). During the months of March, April, May and June 2006, Paulo Coelho traveled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella in 1986. He also held surprise book signings - announced one day in advance - in some cities along the way, to have a chance to meet his readers. In ninety days of pilgrimage the author traveled around the globe and took the famous Transiberrian train that took him to Vladivostok. During this experience Paulo Coelho launched his blog Walking the Path - The Pilgrimage in order to share with his readers his impressions. Since this first blog Paulo Coelho has expanded his presence in the internet with his daily blogs in Wordpress, Myspace &amp; Facebook. He is equally present in media sharing sites such as Youtube and Flickr, offering on a regular basis not only texts but also videos and pictures to his readers. From this intensive interest and use of the Internet sprang his bold new project: The Experimental Witch where he invites his readers to adapt to the screen his book The Witch of Portobello. Indeed Paulo Coelho is a firm believer of Internet as a new media and is the first Best-selling author to actively support online free distribution of his work.",

        "biography": "Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton PC, was an English novelist, poet, playwright, and politician. Lord Lytton was a florid, popular writer of his day, who coined such phrases as \"the great unwashed\", \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\", \"the pen is mightier than the sword\", and the infamous incipit \"It was a dark and stormy night.\"<br /><br />He was the youngest son of General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. He had two brothers, William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799\u20131877) and Henry, afterwards Lord Dalling and Bulwer.<br /><br />Lord Lytton's original surname was Bulwer, the names 'Earle' and 'Lytton' were middle names. On 20 February 1844 he assumed the name and arms of Lytton by royal licence and his surname then became 'Bulwer-Lytton'. His widowed mother had done the same in 1811. His brothers were always simply surnamed 'Bulwer'.<br />",

        "biography": "John Steinbeck III was an American writer. He wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and the novella Of Mice and Men, published in 1937. In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. <br /><br />In 1962 Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck grew up in the Salinas Valley region of California, a culturally diverse place of rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place. <br /><br />Steinbeck moved briefly to New York City, but soon returned home to California to begin his career as a writer. Most of his earlier work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel Cup of Gold which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.<br /><br />In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. Later he used real historical conditions and events in the first half of 20th century America, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. <br /><br />Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. His later body of work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history, and mythology. <br /><br />One of his last published works was Travels with Charley, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America. He died in 1968 in New York of a heart attack and his ashes are interred in Salinas.<br /><br />Seventeen of his works, including The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Cannery Row (1945), The Pearl (1947), and East of Eden (1952), went on to become Hollywood films, and Steinbeck also achieved success as a Hollywood writer, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Story in 1944 for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat.",

        "biography": "W. Timothy Gallwey (born 1938 in San Francisco, California) is an author who has written a series of books in which he has set forth a new methodology for coaching and for the development of personal and professional excellence in a variety of fields, that he calls \"The Inner Game.\" Since he began writing in the 1970s, his books include The Inner Game of Tennis, The Inner Game of Golf, The Inner game of Music (with Barry Green), Inner Skiing and The Inner Game of Work. Gallwey's seminal work is the The Inner Game of Tennis, with more than one million copies in print.[1] Besides sports, his training methods have been applied to the fields of business, health, and education.[1]<br /><br />In 1960, Gallwey was captain of the Harvard University Tennis Team. In the 1970s he learned the meditation techniques of the Divine Light Mission's Guru Maharaj Ji, which Gallwey said enhanced his powers of concentration in a manner that improved his game.[2] In a 1973 New York Times article he described his discovery of Maharaj Ji and his decision to live in an ashram and practice celibacy.[3] In 1997, Gallwey dedicated his book, The Inner Game of Tennis, to him.[4]<br /><br />The \"inner game\" is based upon certain principles in which an individual uses non-judgmental observations of critical variables, with the purpose of being accurate about these observations. If the observations are accurate, the person's body will adjust and correct automatically to achieve best performance.[5] Gallwey was one of the first to demonstrate a comprehensive method of coaching that could be applied to many situations, and found himself lecturing more often to business leaders in the U.S. than to sports people.[6]<br /><br />Tim Gallwey's work went on to found the current movement in business coaching, life coaching and executive coaching. One of the most well known exponents of business coaching is Sir John Whitmore, who popularised Graham Alexander's and Alan Fine's \"GROW\" model of the coaching process.[6]<br /><br /> In every human endeavor there are two arenas of engagement: the outer and the inner. The outer game is played on an external arena to overcome external obstacles to reach an external goal. The inner game takes place within the mind of the player and is played against such obstacles as fear, self-doubt, lapses in focus, and limiting concepts or assumptions. The inner game is played to overcome the self-imposed obstacles that prevent an individual or team from accessing their full potential.",

Andrews name</b><br /><br />Virginia Cleo Andrews (born Cleo Virginia Andrews) was born June 6, 1923 in Portsmouth, Virginia. The youngest child and the only daughter of William Henry Andrews, a career navy man who opened a tool-and-die business after retirement, and Lillian Lilnora Parker Andrews, a telephone operator. She spent her happy childhood years in Portsmouth, Virginia, living briefly in Rochester, New York. The Andrews family returned to Portsmouth while Virginia was in high school.<br /><br />While a teenager, Virginia suffered a tragic accident, falling down the stairs at her school and incurred severe back injuries. Arthritis and a failed spinal surgical procedure forced her to spend most of her life on crutches or in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Virginia excelled in school and, at fifteen, won a scholarship for writing a parody of Tennyson's <i>Idylls of the King</i>. She proudly earned her diploma from Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth. After graduation, she nurtured her artistic talent by completing a four-year correspondence art course while living at home with her family.<br /><br />After William Andrews died in the late 1960s, Virginia helped to support herself and her mother through her extremely successful career as a commercial artist, portrait painter, and fashion illustrator.<br /><br />Frustrated with the lack of creative satisfaction that her work provided, Virginia sought creative release through writing, which she did in secret. In 1972, she completed her first novel, <i>The Gods of the Green Mountain</i> [sic], a science-fantasy story. It was never published. Between 1972 and 1979, she wrote nine novels and twenty short stories, of which only one was published. \"I Slept with My Uncle on My Wedding Night\", a short fiction piece, was published in a pulp confession magazine.<br /><br />Promise gleamed over the horizon for Virginia when she submitted a 290,000-word novel, <i>The Obsessed</i>, to a publishing company. She was told that the story had potential, but needed to be trimmed and spiced up a bit. She drafted a new outline in a single night and added \"unspeakable things my mother didn't want me to write about.\" The ninety-eight-page revision was re-titled <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> and she was paid a $7,500 advance. Her new-generation Gothic novel reached the bestseller lists a mere two weeks after its 1979 paperback publication by Pocket Books.<br /><br /><i>Petals on the Wind</i>, her sequel to <i>Flowers</i>, was published the next year, earning Virginia a $35,000 advance. The second book remained on the New York Times bestseller list for an unbelievable nineteen weeks (<i>Flowers</i> also returned to the list). These first two novels alone sold over seven million copies in only two years. The third novel of the Dollanganger series, <i>If There Be Thorns</i>, was released in 1981, bringing Virginia a $75,000 advance. It reached No. 2 on many bestseller lists within its first two weeks.<br /><br />Taking a break from the chronicles of Chris and Cathy Dollanganger, Virginia published her one, and only, stand-alone novel, <i>My Sweet Audrina</i>, in 1982. The book welcomed an immediate success, topping the sales figures of her previous novels. Two years later, a fourth Dollanganger novel was released, <i>Seeds of Yesterday</i>. According to the New York Times, <i>Seeds</i> was the best-selling fiction paperback novel of 1984. Also in 1984, V.C. Andrews was named \"Professional Woman of the Year\" by the city of Norfolk, Virginia.<br /><br />Upon Andrews's death in 1986, two final novels\u2014<i>Garden of Shadows</i> and <i>Fallen Hearts</i>\u2014were published. These two novels are considered the last to bear the \"V.C. Andrews\" name and to be almost completely written by",

        "biography": "Mildred Grieveson was born on October 10, 1946 in England. She had written all through her infant and junior years and on into her teens, the stories changing from children's adventures to torrid gypsy passions. Her mother used to gather these up from time to time, when her bedroom became too untidy, and dispose of them!<br /><br />Mildred has always wanted to write - which is not to say she has always wanted to be a professional writer. One the contrary, for years She wrote only for her own pleasure, and it wasn't until her husband suggested that she ought to send one of her stories to a publisher that they put several publishers names into a hat and pulled one out. The trouble was, she never used to finish any of the stories, and Caroline, her first published book as Anne Mather, was the first book she'd actually completed. She was newly married then, and her daughter was just a baby, and it was quite a job juggling her household chores and scribbling away in exercise books every chance she got. Not very professional, as you can see, but that's the way it was. The rest as they say in history. And now, more than 160 books later, she's literally - excuse the pun - staggered by what happened. She also published books as Caroline Fleming or Cardine Fleming. Her Anne Mather's novel, Leopard in the Snow, was developed into a 1978 movie.<br /><br />Mildred now has two grown-up children, a son and daughter, and two adorable grandchildren, Abigail and Ben.",

Hill's works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. He became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1936. \"What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve\" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions. How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach of the average person, were the focal points of Hill's books.",

        "biography": "Riki Wilchins is an activist whose work has focused on the impact of gender norms. While she started out as a transgender leader -- founding the first national transgender advocacy group (GenderPAC) -- her analysis and work broadened over time to include discrimination and violence regardless of individuals' identity. While this perspective has been widely accepted, its breadth has provoked criticism by some in the transgender community. Wilchins' work and writing has often focused on youth, whom she not only sees as uniquely vulnerable to the gender system's pressures and harm, but whom she sees as capable of \"looking with fresh eyes.\" Wilchins' work has been instrumental in bringing transgender rights into the mainstream LGBT movmement, and has helped bring awareness of the impact of gender norms to a wider audience. In 2001, Wilchins' work resulted in her being selected one of just six community activists named by TIME Magazine among its \"100 Civic Innovators for the 21st Century.\" <br /><br />A founding member of Camp Trans, since the mid-1990s Wilchins has been highly active in founding a number of organizations and events focused on gender issues, including:<br /><br />The Transexual Menace, the first large direct action group for transgender rights, which was modeled along the lines of Queer Nation and which at one point boasted representatives in 40+ cities (co-founder Denise Norris).<br />Hermaphrodites With Attitude, the first direct action group for the intersex (co-founder Cheryl Chase, Executive Director of the ISNA, the Intersex Society of North America).<br />NYC Gay Community Center Gender Identity Project (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).<br />NYC Gay Community Center Transgender Health Empowerment Conference, an annual event (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).<br />Camp Trans, an annual educational event outside the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival that contests the exclusion of anyone who is not deemed a \"womyn-born womyn\" (co-founders Janice Walworth, Nancy Jean Burkholder).<br />National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (co-founder Susan Wright, its first Exec. Dir.)<br />National Gender Lobby Day, an annual event on Capitol Hill (co-founder Phyllis Frye).<br /><br />In 1995 Wilchins founded the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition GenderPAC, a tax-exempt organization focused on gender rights issues. GenderPAC originally focused on the transgender community, but gradually broadened its focus to include anyone who suffered discrimination or violence because of their gender identity or gender expression. GenderPAC described its mission as the creation of \"classrooms, communities, and workplaces [that] are safe for everyone to learn, grow, and succeed - whether or not they meet expectations for masculinity and femininity.\" <br /><br />In late 1999, the organization was incorporated and received tax-exempt status. In 2009 it rebranded and relaunched as a new organization, effectively ceasing operations as GenderPAC. While GenderPAC's Executive Director, Wilchins helped dozens of corporations as diverse as IBM, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, as well as major funders like the Arcus and Gill Foundations to expand their employment non-discrimination policies to include gender identity and gender expression. GenderPAC's Congressional Non-Discrimination Pledge eventually had almost 200 sponsors, including both Republicans and US Senators. She helped compile and publish the GENIUS (Gender Equality National Index for Universities &amp; Schools) Index, which rated and ranked schools' adoption of gender identity protections. During her watch, GenderPAC also launched the GenderYOUTH Network, which eventually supported student groups at 100+ schools in creating safer and friendlier environments for those who were gender non-conforming on their own campuses.<br /><br />With help from researcher Emilia Lombardi, GenderPAC compiled and published the \"1st National Survey of TransViolence,\" based on surveys provided by more than 500.",

Her interests range from the natural world (i.e. Thinking about Ants) to American history (e.g. Wagon Wheels), all of which are reflected in the wide scope of her work. Brenner discussed with Contemporary Authors Online her influences and how they have affected her literary career, concluding that \u201call the circumstances of my life conspired to make me a writer--just lucky, I guess.\u201d<br /><br />Brenner was born Barbara Lawrence on June 26, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, to Robert Lawrence (a real estate broker) and Marguerite (Furboter) Johnes. Tragically, her mother died when Brenner was just a year old, and, according to Brenner, this has been a large influence on her career, with Contemporary Authors Online showing how this has added a certain level of \u201csensitivity\u201d to her work. She also defines Brooklyn as a place which gave much \u201ccolor\u201d to her work, and where her father\u2019s ambitions for her helped to develop Brenner\u2019s intellectual curiosity.<br /><br />Brenner attended Seton Hall College (now University) and Rutgers University from 1942-46, whilst also working as a copy editor at Prudential Insurance Co. from 1942 \u2013 46. Her freelance work as an artist\u2019s agent prepared her for a literary life, as after the birth of her two children she began work on her first book Somebody\u2019s Slippers, Somebody\u2019s Shoes, published in 1957. She followed this book with an educational picture book entitled Barto Takes the Subway, designed to improve reading comprehension and sight vocabulary<br /><br />Her artistic development continued when she began to collaborate with her husband, illustrator Fred Brenner, on The Flying Patchwork Quilt. Her next book, On the Frontier with Mr. Audubon, was selected by School Library Journal as \u201cThe Best of the Best\u201d among children\u2019s books published over 26 seasons. In a review of On the Frontier with Mr. Audubon, Paul Showers wrote in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cBrenner again demonstrates her gift for invention and respect for facts . . . [it is] written in the polite but colloquial language of the frontier sketching in Audubon\u2019s biographical background and recording events of the journey as they might have been observed by a serious, very perceptive 13- year-old.\u201d One of her best-selling titles was Wagon Wheels (published in 1978), which deals with the trials and tribulations of a close-knit African American family. This true to life story is \u201cexciting and realistic\u201d according to Gisela Jernigan (writing in the children literature journal Booklist), and was named a 1978 American Library Association Notable Book.<br /><br />Throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s Brenner continued to publish, many of her works being influenced by the careers and interests of her sons. Speaking to Contemporary Authors Online Brenner explains that as their sons are both grown, and their respective careers as a \u201cbiologist . . . and musician\u201d have both had an influence on her writing (i.e. Dinosaurium 1993). In 1986, Brenner was honored with the Pennsylvania School Librarians\u2019 Association\u2019s Outstanding Pennsylvania Author Award. Brenner\u2019s most celebrated book is a collection entitled Voices: Poetry and Art from around the World, for which she was chief editor. This book received an ALA Notable Book for Children mention and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults award. According to the Horn Book Guide from Spring 2001, \u201cmore than three hundred and fifty poems from six continents evoke the specific and the universal\u201d with contributions from both \u201ccelebrated and unknown poets, Nobel prize winners, and children\u201d allowing the book to demonstrate Brenner\u2019s skill in celebrating \u201cplace\u201d and the \u201cshared feelings\u201d of the people about whom the book is written.<br /><br />Barbara Brenner is still writing, and currentl",

In nine short chapters, Lappe leaves readers feeling liberated and courageous. She flouts conventional right-versus-left divisions and affirms readers' basic sanity - their intuitive knowledge that it is possible to stop grasping at straws and grasp the real roots of today's crises, from hunger and poverty to climate change and terrorism. Because we are creatures of the mind, says Lappe, it is the power of \"frame\"--our core assumptions about how the world works--that determines outcomes. She pinpoints the dominant failing frame now driving out planet toward disaster. By interweaving fresh insights, startling facts, and stirring vignettes of ordinary people pursuing creative solutions to our most pressing global problems, Lappe uncovers a new, empowering \"frame\" through which real solutions are emerging worldwide.\"<br />Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9 is married to Dr. Marc Lapp\u00e9 a former experimental pathologist interested in the problem of environmental contamination.",
