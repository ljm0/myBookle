His arguably best-known work, The Collapse of Complex Societies (1988), examines the collapse of Maya and Chacoan civilizations,[2] and of the Western Roman Empire, in terms of network theory, energy economics and complexity theory. Tainter argues that sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions[3] and that societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their \"energy subsidies\" reach a point of diminishing marginal returns. He recognizes collapse when a society rapidly sheds a significant portion of its complexity.<br />",

        "biography": "\"Long before his name became synonymous with the modern legal thriller, he was working 60-70 hours a week at a small Southaven, Mississippi law practice, squeezing in time before going to the office and during courtroom recesses to work on his hobby\u2014writing his first novel.<br /><br />Born on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to a construction worker and a homemaker, John Grisham as a child dreamed of being a professional baseball player. Realizing he didn't have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990.<br /><br />One day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl's father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988.<br /><br />That might have put an end to Grisham's hobby. However, he had already begun his next book, and it would quickly turn that hobby into a new full-time career\u2014and spark one of publishing's greatest success stories. The day after Grisham completed A Time to Kill, he began work on another novel, the story of a hotshot young attorney lured to an apparently perfect law firm that was not what it appeared. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.<br /><br />The successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham's reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham's success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller.<br /><br />Since first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, and The Broker) and all of them have become international bestsellers. There are currently over 225 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, which have been translated into 29 languages. Nine of his novels have been turned into films (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, A Painted House, The Runaway Jury, and Skipping Christmas), as was an original screenplay, The Gingerbread Man. The Innocent Man (October 2006) marks his first foray into non-fiction.<br /><br />Grisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea. The family splits their time between their Victorian home on a farm in Mississippi and a plantation near Charlottesville, VA.<br /><br />Grisham took time off from writing for several months in 1996 to return, after a five-year hiatus, to the courtroom. He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer: representing the family of a railroad brakeman killed when he was pinned between two cars. Preparing his case with the same passion and dedication as his books' protagonists, Grisham successfully argued his clients' case, earning them a jur",

His work is frequently associated with postmodernism and post-structuralism.<br /><br />Jean Baudrillard was also a Professor of Philosophy of Culture and Media Criticism at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, where he taught an Intensive Summer Seminar.<br /><br />Jean Baudrillard's philosophy centers on the twin concepts of 'hyperreality' and 'simulation'. These terms refer to the virtual or unreal nature of contemporary culture in an age of mass communication and mass consumption. We live in a world dominated by simulated experiences and feelings, Jean Baudrillard believes, and have lost the capacity to comprehend reality as it actually exists. We experience only prepared realities--edited war footage, meaningless acts of terrorism, the destruction of cultural values and the substitution of 'referendum'. <br /><br />In Jean Baudrillard's words,<br /><br /><i>\"The very definition of the real has become: that of which it is possible to give an equivalent reproduction...The real is not only what can be reproduced, but that which is always already reproduced: that is the hyperreal...which is entirely in simulation.\"</i>",

He lived for many years with his English wife and four children in North Yorkshire. He and his family then moved to New Hampshire in America for a few years, but they have now returned to live in the UK.<br /><br />In <i>The Lost Continent</i>, Bill Bryson's hilarious first travel book, he chronicled a trip in his mother's Chevy around small town America. It was followed by <i>Neither Here Nor There</i>, an account of his first trip around Europe. Other travel books include the massive bestseller <i>Notes From a Small Island</i>, which won the 2003 World Book Day National Poll to find the book which best represented modern England, followed by <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> (in which Stephen Katz, his travel companion from <i>Neither Here Nor There</i>, made a welcome reappearance), <i>Notes From a Big Country</i> and <i>Down Under</i>.<br /><br />Bill Bryson has also written several highly praised books on the English language, including <i>Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America</i>. In his last book, he turned his attention to science. <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> was lauded with critical acclaim, and became a huge bestseller. It was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize, before going on to win the Aventis Prize for Science Books and the Descartes Science Communication Prize. His next book, <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</i>, is a memoir of growing up in 1950s America, featuring another appearance from his old friend Stephen Katz. October 8 sees the publication of <i>A Really Short History of Nearly Everything<i>.</i></i>",

He grew up in Brooklyn, pre-revolutionary Cuba and Ireland. At 18 he was associated with members of the IRA, and was asked to leave Ireland. At Cornell University in the late fifties Farina was suspended for his part in a student protest, but was promptly reinstated when fellow students threatened to take further action to support him.<br />Leaving Cornell in 1959, he lived in Paris and London, surviving by 'music, street-singing, scriptwriting, acting, a little smuggling, anything to hang on'. In 1963 he returned to America and married Mimi Baez, sister of Joan, and they became a folk duo. Their debut album was recommended by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the ten best releases of 1965.<br />Farina was killed in a motorbike accident, just two days after his book <i>Been Down so Long It Looks Like Up to Me</i> had been published.",

        "biography": "My journey to becoming an author has been a roundabout one, taking in many other careers. I grew up on the edge of Epping Forest and was that dreamy kind of child who was always writing stories. After reading English at Cambridge, I decided to find out as much as I could about the wider world so joined the Foreign Office and served in Poland. My work as a diplomat took me from the high point of town twinning in the Tatra Mountains to the low of inspecting the bottom of a Silesian coal mine.<br /><br />On leaving Poland, I exchanged diplomacy for academia and took a doctorate in the literature of the English Romantic Period at Oxford. I then joined Oxfam as a lobbyist on conflict issues, campaigning at the UN and with governments to lessen the impact of conflict on civilians living in war zones - a cause about which I still feel very passionate.<br /><br />Married with three children, I now live in Oxford between two rivers, surrounded by gargoyles, beautiful sandstone buildings and ancient trees.<br /><br />My first novel, 'The Diamond of Drury Lane', won the Waterstone's Children's Book Prize 2006 and the Nestle Children's Book Prize 2006 (formerly known as the Smarties Prize). I was also chosen by Waterstone's in 2007 as one of their 'Twenty-five authors for the future'. In the US, 'Secret of the Sirens' won the honor book medal of the Green Earth Book Award. <br /><br />My latest series, which starts with Mel Foster and the Demon Butler, about an intrepid Victorian orphan who lives in a household of monsters, won Bronze in the Primary Teacher awards in 2015. The next part, Mel Foster and the Time Machine, has set the time-dial to arrive in 2016.",

        "biography": "Today, almost every perfume is created from synthetic essences. Although synthetics approximate the odors of natural ingredients, they have none of the complexity, mystery or emotional depth. We bring an inexplicable emotional intensity to the experience of an authentic smell and the memories it sparks and creates. <br /><br />My approach to creating artisan natural perfumes is based in the quality and integrity of the ingredients. I hand blend each perfume from my collection of extraordinary essences, which I have gathered with uncompromising standards for only the finest quality 100% pure and natural materials. I seek out exotic, unusual essences from hidden corners of the world, often smelling a dozen versions of the same oil, searching for the one that surpasses the rest. Finding the essences is like a quest, and I enjoy it as much as the act of creation. Through years of searching I have amassed a comprehensive and strikingly beautiful palette from which to work. <br /><br />In each perfume, I try to capture a feeling and aesthetic experience. I start with a concept for the perfume, and work to create something modern and luxurious. With some perfumes, the first iteration is almost perfect. Others take endless revisions and weeks of blending until everything comes together in the ideal balance. <br /><br />Once the formulas are developed, I hand blend small batches of perfume, and bottle it in the same studio it was created in. I am connected to the whole process, and it makes me very happy when people incorporate my perfumes in their lives. It is my hope that people have a feeling of luxury, well-being, beauty and excitement when they wear Aftelier Perfumes. <br /><br />In addition to my work as a perfumer, I am the author of six books, three of which are on natural perfume. <i>Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume</i> has been translated into seven languages and was the winner of The Sense of Smell Institute's Richard B. Solomon Award. <i>Aroma</i>, a cookbook (co-authored with chef Daniel Patterson), focuses on the essential link between food and fragrance and includes recipes for both. <i>Scents &amp; Sensibilities</i> guides the reader through the history and creation of solid perfumes. <br /><br />My three other books are <i>The Story of Your Life: Becoming the Author of Your Experience</i>, <i>When Talk is Not Cheap</i> and <i>Death of a Rolling Stone: The Brian Jones Story</i>. <br /><br />In early 2009, Living Perfume: The Natural Alchemy of Mandy Aftel, debuted at the Fifth Avenue store, Henri Bendel. The exhibit focused on education and the history of perfumery. It showcased my perfumes as well as my extraordinary collection of perfume memorabilia. The event was commemorated in a catalogue, which can be viewed here. <br /><br />As the curator for an exhibition on the history of natural perfume The Foul and the Fragrant: Creating Natural Perfume at the Doheny Memorial Library, University of Southern California I displayed turn-of-the-century perfume books and vintage memorabilia from my private collection. My artistry with natural perfumery was the subject of the exhibit, Constructing Perfume: Scent, Space, Color at 3A Gallery in San Francisco, which included architectural renderings of my fragrances, and an interactive experience of viewers matching color chips to scents. <br /><br />In 2004, I was invited to create a perfume for a 2000 year old child mummy in conjunction with the Stanford Medical Center, the Rosicrucian Museum and Silicon Graphics (SGI). <br /><br />In addition to my work with Michelin-starred chef Daniel Patterson (Coi Restaurant), I have worked with Daniel Barber (Blue Hill, Blue Hill at Stone Barns), Johnny Iuzinni (Jean Georges), and other chefs. I have conducted classes and demonstrations for vintners and sommeliers, and at the University of Southern California, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Ideo, Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, Apple, Clif Bar, the James Beard Foundation, New York University, Slow Food, London Design Festival, Esalen Ins",

        "biography": "Steve McCurry, recognized universally as one of today\u2019s finest image-makers, has won many of photography\u2019s top awards. Best known for his evocative color photography, McCurry, in the finest documentary tradition, captures the essence of human struggle and joy. Member of Magnum Photos since 1986, McCurry has searched and found the unforgettable; many of his images have become modern icons. Born in Philadelphia, McCurry graduated cum laude from the College of Arts and Architecture at the Pennsylvania State University. After working at a newspaper for two years, he left for India to freelance. It was in India that McCurry learned to watch and wait on life. \u201cIf you wait,\u201d he realized, \u201cpeople will forget your camera and the soul will drift up into view.\u201d<br /><br />His career was launched when, disguised in native garb, he crossed the Pakistan border into rebel-controlled Afghanistan just before the Russian invasion. When he emerged, he had rolls of film sewn into his clothes of images that would be published around the world as among the first to show the conflict there. His coverage won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad, an award dedicated to photographers exhibiting exceptional courage and enterprise. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including Magazine Photographer of the Year, awarded by the National Press Photographers\u2019 Association. That was the same year in which he won an unprecedented four first prizes in the World Press Photo Contest. He has won the Olivier Rebbot Memorial Award twice.<br /><br />Steve McCurry has covered many areas of international and civil conflict, including the Iran-Iraq war, the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, Beirut, Cambodia, the Philippines, the Gulf War, and continuing coverage of Afghanistan. He focuses on the human consequences of war, not only showing what war impresses on the landscape, but rather, on the human face. <br /><br />McCurry\u2019s work has been featured in every major magazine in the world and frequently appears in National Geographic magazine with recent articles on the Hazaras of Afghanistan, Buddhism, Tibet, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and the temples of Angkor Wat, Cambodia. McCurry is driven by an innate curiosity and sense of wonder about the world and everyone in it. He has an uncanny ability to cross boundaries of language and culture to capture stories of human experience. \u201cMost of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape that you could call the human condition.\u201d <br /><br />A high point in his career was the rediscovery of the previously unidentified Afghan refugee girl that many have described as the most recognizable photograph in the world today. When McCurry finally located Sharbat Gula after almost two decades, he said, \u201cHer skin is weathered; there are wrinkles now, but she is a striking as she was all those years ago.\u201d McCurry returned from an extended assignment in China on September 10, 2001. His coverage at Ground Zero on September 11 is a testament to the heroism and nobility of the people of New York City. \u201cYou felt the horror and immediately, instinctively understood that our lives would never be the same again.\u201d<br /><br />McCurry has published many books including, In the Shadows of Mountains (2007), Looking East (2006), Steve McCurry (2005), The Path to Buddha: A Tibetan Pilgrimage (2003), Sanctuary (2002), South Southeast (2000), Portraits (1999), Monsoon (1988), The Imperial Way (1985).<br />",

He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.",

        "biography": "William Shakespeare (baptised 26 April 1564) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"The Bard\"). His surviving works consist of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language, and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<br /><br />Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. Scholars believe that he died on his fifty-second birthday, coinciding with St George\u2019s Day.<br /><br />At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway, who bore him three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of the playing company the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.<br /><br />Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century. Next he wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including <i>Hamlet, King Lear</i>, and <i>Macbeth</i>, considered some of the finest examples in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime, and in 1623, two of his former theatrical colleagues published the <i>First Folio</i>, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.<br /><br />Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the nineteenth century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians hero-worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \"bardolatry\". In the twentieth century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are consistently performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.<br /><br />According to historians, Shakespeare wrote 37 plays and 154 sonnets throughout the span of his life. Shakespeare's writing average was 1.5 plays a year since he first started writing in 1589. There have been plays and sonnets attributed to Shakespeare that were not authentically written by the great master of language and literature. <br />",

Friedman is an internationally renowned author, reporter, and, columnist\u2014the recipient of three Pulitzer Prizes and the author of six bestselling books, among them <i>From Beirut to Jerusalem</i> and <i>The World Is Flat</i>.<br /><br />Thomas Loren Friedman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on July 20, 1953, and grew up in the middle-class Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park. He is the son of Harold and Margaret Friedman. He has two older sisters, Shelley and Jane.<br /><br />In January 1995, Friedman took over the <i>New York Times Foreign</i> Affairs column. \u201cIt was the job I had always aspired to,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had loved reading columns and op-ed articles ever since I was in high school, when I used to wait around for the afternoon paper, the Minneapolis Star, to be delivered. It carried Peter Lisagor. He was a favorite columnist of mine. I used to grab the paper from the front step and read it on the living room floor.\u201d<br /><br />Friedman has been the <i>Times</i>\u2018s Foreign Affairs columnist since 1995, traveling extensively in an effort to anchor his opinions in reporting on the ground. \u201cI am a big believer in the saying \u2018If you don\u2019t go, you don\u2019t know.\u2019 I tried to do two things with the column when I took it over. First was to broaden the definition of foreign affairs and explore the impacts on international relations of finance, globalization, environmentalism, biodiversity, and technology, as well as covering conventional issues like conflict, traditional diplomacy, and arms control. Second, I tried to write in a way that would be accessible to the general reader and bring a broader audience into the foreign policy conversation\u2014beyond the usual State Department policy wonks. It was somewhat controversial at the time. So, I eventually decided to write a book that would explain the framework through which I was looking at the world. It was a framework that basically said if you want to understand the world today, you have to see it as a constant tension between what was very old in shaping international relations (the passions of nationalism, ethnicity, religion, geography, and culture) and what was very new (technology, the Internet, and the globalization of markets and finance). If you try to see the world from just one of those angles, it won\u2019t make sense. It is all about the intersection of the two.\u201d",

        "biography": "The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO was born in 1947 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Before dedicating his life completely to literature, he worked as theatre director and actor, lyricist and journalist. In 1986, PAULO COELHO did the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella, an experience later to be documented in his book The Pilgrimage. In the following year, COELHO published The Alchemist. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time. Other titles include Brida (1990), The Valkyries (1992), By the river Piedra I sat Down and Wept (1994), the collection of his best columns published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo entitle Maktub (1994), the compilation of texts Phrases (1995), The Fifth Mountain (1996), Manual of a Warrior of Light (1997), Veronika decides to die (1998), The Devil and Miss Prym (2000), the compilation of traditional tales in Stories for parents, children and grandchildren (2001), Eleven Minutes (2003), The Zahir (2005), The Witch of Portobello (2006) and Winner Stands Alone (to be released in 2009). During the months of March, April, May and June 2006, Paulo Coelho traveled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella in 1986. He also held surprise book signings - announced one day in advance - in some cities along the way, to have a chance to meet his readers. In ninety days of pilgrimage the author traveled around the globe and took the famous Transiberrian train that took him to Vladivostok. During this experience Paulo Coelho launched his blog Walking the Path - The Pilgrimage in order to share with his readers his impressions. Since this first blog Paulo Coelho has expanded his presence in the internet with his daily blogs in Wordpress, Myspace &amp; Facebook. He is equally present in media sharing sites such as Youtube and Flickr, offering on a regular basis not only texts but also videos and pictures to his readers. From this intensive interest and use of the Internet sprang his bold new project: The Experimental Witch where he invites his readers to adapt to the screen his book The Witch of Portobello. Indeed Paulo Coelho is a firm believer of Internet as a new media and is the first Best-selling author to actively support online free distribution of his work.",

        "biography": "Anne H\u00e9bert was born on August 1, 1916 in Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault, a small village 40 kilometers from Qu\u00e9bec city. Born into a well-respected Qu\u00e9bec family, whose ancestors included some of the earliest settlers of New France, H\u00e9bert was encouraged in her literary endeavours by her cousin, the poet Hector de Saint-Denis Garneau. The greatest influence on her writing, however, was undoubtedly her father Maurice H\u00e9bert, a part-time literary critic who worked for the Qu\u00e9bec government. He fostered her desire to write and, through his guidance, provided her with a solid literary education. Having begun writing poems, stories, and plays at a very young age, Anne H\u00e9bert found her work being published in a variety of periodicals by the time she was in her early twenties. <br /><br />Anne H\u00e9bert's first volume of poetry, Les Songes en \u00e9quilibre, appeared in 1942 to good critical response and it was awarded the Prix David. Despite this success, however, the violence in her 1945 story \"Le Torrent\" and the darkness of her poetry collection Le Tombeau des rois caused Qu\u00e9bec publishers to refuse to publish them. When the former was finally published in 1950 and the latter in 1952, it was done at the personal expense of Roger Lemelin and H\u00e9bert respectively. In 1954 H\u00e9bert used a grant from the Royal Society to continue her writing in Paris, a setting she thought would be more receptive to the style and subject matter of her writing. From that moment on, though she frequently visits Canada, Paris would be her home as well as the location of the publisher of all her subsequent books, the prestigious French publisher Les \u00c9ditions du Seuil. <br />...<br />Fortunately for English readers in Canada and around the world, Anne H\u00e9bert is one of the most translated writers from Qu\u00e9bec. Two volumes of her poetry, Anne H\u00e9bert: Selected Poems (1987) and Day Has No Equal but the Night are still in print, while translations of her plays \"La Merci\u00e8re assassin\u00e9e\" (\"The Murdered Shopkeeper\"), \"Le Temps Sauvage\" (\"The Unquiet State\"), and \"Les Invit\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s\" (\"The Guests on Trial\") were published in the journal Canadian Drama between 1983 and 1988 (issues 9.1, 10.2, and 14.2 respectively). Though some translations of her fiction are currently out of print, the following texts have appeared in English over the years: The Torrent (1973, translated by Gwendolyn Moore), The Silent Rooms (1974, translated by Kathy Mezei), Kamouraska (1974, translated by Norman Shapiro), Children of the Black Sabbath (1977, translated by Carol Dunlop-H\u00e9bert), H\u00e9lo\u00efse (1982, translated by Sheila Fischman), In the Shadow of the Wind (1983, translated by Sheila Fischman), The First Garden (1991, translated by Sheila Fischman and winner of the F\u00e9lix Antoine-Savard Prize for Translation), and Aur\u00e9lien, Clara, Mademoiselle, and the English Lieutenant (1996, translated by Sheila Fischman). Anne H\u00e9bert is also one of the writers from Canada whose work is well known by readers from around the world. Kamouraska, for instance, has been translated into at least seven languages, including Spanish, Italian, German, and Japanese and was adapted for film by Claude Jutra. <br /><br />Over the course of her nearly sixty year career, Anne H\u00e9bert has won many literary awards including the Prix David in 1942 for Les Songes en \u00e9quilibre, the Prix France-Canada and the Prix Duvernay in 1958 for Les Chambres de bois, the Governor General's Literary Award in 1960 for Po\u00e8mes, the Molson Prize in 1967, a second Governor General's Award in 1975 for Les Enfants du sabbat, and the Prix F\u00e9mina in 1982 for Les Fous de Bassan. <br /><br />For her immense contribution to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois literature and for the great impact her work has had on Canadian and international readers, Northwest Passages is pleased to recognize Anne H\u00e9bert as our feature author for the month of March, 1998.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",

A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, since his death Guevara's stylized visage has become an ubiquitous countercultural symbol and global icon within popular culture.<br /><br />His belief in the necessity of world revolution to advance the interests of the poor prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Arbenz, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow solidified Guevara's radical ideology. Later, while living in Mexico City, he met Ra\u00fal and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66099.Fidel_Castro\" title=\"Fidel Castro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fidel Castro</a>, joined their movement, and travelled to Cuba with the intention of overthrowing the U.S.-backed Batista regime. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the successful two year guerrilla campaign that topled the Cuban government.<br /><br />After serving in a number of key roles in the new government, Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and executed.<br /><br />Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. <i>Time</i> magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, while an Alberto Korda photograph of him entitled \"Guerrillero Heroico,\" was declared \"the most famous photograph in the world\" by the Maryland Institute of Art.",

Hailing from Long Island, Pynchon spent two years in the United States Navy and earned an English degree from Cornell University. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known today: <i>V.</i> (1963), <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> (1966), <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> (1973), <i>Vineland</i> (1990), <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> (1997), and <i>Against the Day</i> (2006).<br /><br />Pynchon is regarded by many readers and critics as one of the finest contemporary authors. He is a MacArthur Fellow and a recipient of the National Book Award, and is regularly cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Both his fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, styles, and themes, including (but not limited to) the fields of history, science and mathematics. Pynchon is also known for his avoidance of personal publicity: very few photographs of him have ever been published, and rumours about his location and identity have been circulated since the 1960's.<br />",

Garc\u00ed\u00ada M\u00e1rquez, familiarly known as \"Gabo\" in his native country, was considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />He studied at the University of Bogot\u00e1 and later worked as a reporter for the Colombian newspaper <i>El Espectador</i> and as a foreign correspondent in Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Caracas and New York. He wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (1967) and <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in order to explain real experiences. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude.<br /><br />Having previously written shorter fiction and screenplays, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sequestered himself away in his Mexico City home for an extended period of time to complete his novel <i>Cien a\u00f1os de soledad</i>, or <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, published in 1967. The author drew international acclaim for the work, which ultimately sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is credited with helping introduce an array of readers to magical realism, a genre that combines more conventional storytelling forms with vivid, layered fantasy.<br /><br />Another one of his novels, <i>El amor</i> en <i>los tiempos del c\u00f3lera</i> (1985), or <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, drew a large global audience as well. The work was partially based on his parents' courtship and was adapted into a 2007 film starring Javier Bardem. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote seven novels during his life, with additional titles including <i>El general en su laberinto (1989)</i>, or <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>, and <i>Del amor y otros demonios (1994)</i>, or <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i>.<br /><br />(Arabic: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5029628._\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632</a>) (Hebrew: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7091051._\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d2\u05d0\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05e8\u05e7\u05e1</a>)",

        "biography": "<i>Librarian Note: There is more than one author by this name in the Goodreads database.</i><br /><br />Barbara Brenner is a respected, award-winning author, specializing in works of both juvenile fiction and nonfiction educational material that deals with animals, nature, and ecology. Her interests range from the natural world (i.e. Thinking about Ants) to American history (e.g. Wagon Wheels), all of which are reflected in the wide scope of her work. Brenner discussed with Contemporary Authors Online her influences and how they have affected her literary career, concluding that \u201call the circumstances of my life conspired to make me a writer--just lucky, I guess.\u201d<br /><br />Brenner was born Barbara Lawrence on June 26, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, to Robert Lawrence (a real estate broker) and Marguerite (Furboter) Johnes. Tragically, her mother died when Brenner was just a year old, and, according to Brenner, this has been a large influence on her career, with Contemporary Authors Online showing how this has added a certain level of \u201csensitivity\u201d to her work. She also defines Brooklyn as a place which gave much \u201ccolor\u201d to her work, and where her father\u2019s ambitions for her helped to develop Brenner\u2019s intellectual curiosity.<br /><br />Brenner attended Seton Hall College (now University) and Rutgers University from 1942-46, whilst also working as a copy editor at Prudential Insurance Co. from 1942 \u2013 46. Her freelance work as an artist\u2019s agent prepared her for a literary life, as after the birth of her two children she began work on her first book Somebody\u2019s Slippers, Somebody\u2019s Shoes, published in 1957. She followed this book with an educational picture book entitled Barto Takes the Subway, designed to improve reading comprehension and sight vocabulary<br /><br />Her artistic development continued when she began to collaborate with her husband, illustrator Fred Brenner, on The Flying Patchwork Quilt. Her next book, On the Frontier with Mr. Audubon, was selected by School Library Journal as \u201cThe Best of the Best\u201d among children\u2019s books published over 26 seasons. In a review of On the Frontier with Mr. Audubon, Paul Showers wrote in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cBrenner again demonstrates her gift for invention and respect for facts . . . [it is] written in the polite but colloquial language of the frontier sketching in Audubon\u2019s biographical background and recording events of the journey as they might have been observed by a serious, very perceptive 13- year-old.\u201d One of her best-selling titles was Wagon Wheels (published in 1978), which deals with the trials and tribulations of a close-knit African American family. This true to life story is \u201cexciting and realistic\u201d according to Gisela Jernigan (writing in the children literature journal Booklist), and was named a 1978 American Library Association Notable Book.<br /><br />Throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s Brenner continued to publish, many of her works being influenced by the careers and interests of her sons. Speaking to Contemporary Authors Online Brenner explains that as their sons are both grown, and their respective careers as a \u201cbiologist . . . and musician\u201d have both had an influence on her writing (i.e. Dinosaurium 1993). In 1986, Brenner was honored with the Pennsylvania School Librarians\u2019 Association\u2019s Outstanding Pennsylvania Author Award. Brenner\u2019s most celebrated book is a collection entitled Voices: Poetry and Art from around the World, for which she was chief editor. This book received an ALA Notable Book for Children mention and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults award. According to the Horn Book Guide from Spring 2001, \u201cmore than three hundred and fifty poems from six continents evoke the specific and the universal\u201d with contributions from both \u201ccelebrated and unknown poets, Nobel prize winners, and children\u201d allowing the book to demonstrate Brenner\u2019s skill in celebrating \u201cplace\u201d and the \u201cshared feelings\u201d of the people about whom the book is written.<br /><br />Barbara Brenner is still writing, and currentl",

        "biography": "Angela Knight is an American author of mostly erotic fantasy. She was a reporter for ten years and a comic book author. She lives in South Carolina. First published under Red Sage, she was able to write romantic fiction for the first time in 1996. She published several short stories in their Secrets anthologies. Editor Cindy Hwang brought her to Berkley Publishing and has helped her become a best selling author.<br /><br />When developing her Mageverse series she wanted to create a unique spin on the vampire tale. Taking the Arthurian legend and twisting it, she has vampires that are not evil, still possess their souls, and can reproduce. Merlin was an alien who traveled to Earth from the Mageverse (an alternate world where magic is everywhere) to establish protectors. Merlin's race had seen species that destroyed themselves as they advanced. To avoid this, he searched Earth for worthy men and women who would give everything to protect others. After drinking from the Grail, men became Magi, vampires and women became Majae, witches. They have a symbiotic relationship. The Magi have to drink blood from the Majae to help absorb the energies of the Mageverse. The Majae have to donate blood or they will suffer heart attack from excess blood and elevated pressure. The Majae are the magic in the Mageverse. The Magi also sleep during the day as another means of gaining magic. The men and women could theoretically live forever, should they not be killed.<br /><br />They are capable of reproducing with mortals to ensure that there are more potential candidates to recruit. Anyone born of such a union is a Latent. Their Gift, becoming Magi or Majae, is triggered by three or sexual encounters with a Gifted man or woman. A Latent must be approved by the Magi or Majae councils. Many can not psychologically handle the impact of the Mageverse (It can trigger insanity). There are professional court seducers who Gift latents on the Councils orders.<br /><br />On Mageverse Earth, there are Fairies, Dragons, Unicorns and the city of Avalon where the Magi and Majae live. They magically create gates to travel to Realspace Earth. The Fairies are featured in Master of the Moon, which has King Llyr of the Faeries.<br /><br />Merlin, who knows that power can corrupt, created another magical species in case the Magi and Majae become out of control. These are werewolves. They do not have to wait until the full moon to change. They are a rigid society that has been hidden from their inception. In Master of Wolves, the werewolves declare themselves and fight alongside the Magi and the Fairies.<br /><br />Master of Swords introduces the dragons of Mageverse in more depth and the hero for Master of Dragons is introduced.<br /><br />Futuristic Books<br /><br />Jane's Warlord introduces Jane Colby, a 20th century reporter. Baran Arvid is sent back from the future to protect her from another time traveler, Druas. Druas travels back in time to commit the Jack the Ripper murders and his next target is Jane. Baran is a technologically and genetically enhanced human classified as a Warlord.<br /><br />Mercenaires is three short stories (originally published electronically) set in a future like Baran\u2019s. They can be technologically and genetically enhanced. Space travel has extended to other galaxies and other life forms have been discovered. Humans have established many new colonies on planets capable of sustaining life.",

        "biography": "I often begin writing when something is bothering me. Years ago, I was thinking about Virginia Woolf\u2019s question: what if Shakespeare had had an equally talented sister? <br />Woolf\u2019s answer: She died without writing a word.<br />What, I wondered, would it take for a woman of that era, with that kind of capacious intelligence, not to die without writing a word?<br />For one thing, she\u2019d have to be a genius at breaking rules.<br />My novel The Weight of Ink reaches back in time to ask the question: what does it take for a woman not to be defeated when everything around her is telling her to sit down and mind her manners? I started writing with two characters in mind, both women who don\u2019t mind their manners: a contemporary historian named Helen Watt and a seventeenth century Inquisition refugee named Ester Velasquez. It\u2019s been a delight working on their story. <br />The Weight of Ink is my third novel, but I\u2019ve also written two other novels and one novella, plus a few dozen essays and stories. Whether I\u2019m writing fiction or nonfiction, I put words to paper because it's my way of metabolizing life. To paraphrase Henry James: I don't really know what I think until I see what I say. <br />Thanks for visiting this page, and for your interest in books.<br />",

Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works, the novels <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world's greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.<br /><br />His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as <i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i>, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.",

Born in New Jersey, she studied music at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and worked for some time as a pianist and piano teacher. She married and raised a family of four children, then separated from her husband and worked as a teacher, secretary, and assistant in a university department. She began Zen practice in her 40s with Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi in Los Angeles, and later with Hakuun Yasutani and Soen Nakagawa. Having received Dharma transmission from Taizan Maezumi Roshi, she opened the Zen Center San Diego in 1983, serving as its head teacher until July 2006.<br />Beck was responsible for a number of important innovations in Zen teaching. In particular, she taught students to work with the emotions of everyday life rather than attempting to avoid or escape them. Because she was adept at teaching students to work with their psychological states, she attracted a number of students who were interested in the relationship between Zen and modern psychology. Several of her Dharma heirs are practicing psychologists/psychiatrists. In 1995 Joko, along with three of her Dharma heirs, founded the Ordinary Mind Zen School.<br />Shortly after Beck\u2019s departure in 2006, she revoked Dharma transmission from two senior students: Ezra Bayda and Elizabeth Hamilton. Beck also stated that Zen Center San Diego should not claim to represent her or her teaching. In 2006 Joko moved to Prescott, Arizona, where she continued to teach until she retired as a teacher in late 2010. In the spring of 2010, Joko announced Gary Nafstad as her last Dharma successor",

        "biography": "For the last 15 years I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be a novelist. Until recently the books were set in the worlds of Wall Street and Washington. In addition to writing, I\u2019ve also had a career in finance with specialties including merger &amp; acquisition advisory and private equity at firms like J.P. Morgan in New York City and Winston Partners just outside D.C. in northern Virginia. <br /><br />So, it seemed natural to write about those two worlds and, fortunately, the publishing industry agreed. My first book was published in 1995, The Takeover; about a secret group of men who were trying to destroy the U.S. monetary system by engineering a massive corporate takeover. I have followed The Takeover with 13 more novels all set in high-level finance and national politics.<br /><br />Recently, I decided to alter the theme. The novels will still have a financial focus, but Wall Street won\u2019t be the backdrop. We\u2019ll get out into the world more. And there will be a man versus nature element for the hero in every novel. Hell\u2019s Gate, available August 2009, is set in Montana and involves forest fires and why many of them start. <br /><br />I live in southwest Florida with my wife, Diana, and we have since 2004 after moving down here from northern Virginia. Given the new direction of my books, it seems like a hurricane ought to make an appearance in a novel sometime soon.",

Timothy Gallwey (born 1938 in San Francisco, California) is an author who has written a series of books in which he has set forth a new methodology for coaching and for the development of personal and professional excellence in a variety of fields, that he calls \"The Inner Game.\" Since he began writing in the 1970s, his books include The Inner Game of Tennis, The Inner Game of Golf, The Inner game of Music (with Barry Green), Inner Skiing and The Inner Game of Work. Gallwey's seminal work is the The Inner Game of Tennis, with more than one million copies in print.[1] Besides sports, his training methods have been applied to the fields of business, health, and education.[1]<br /><br />In 1960, Gallwey was captain of the Harvard University Tennis Team. In the 1970s he learned the meditation techniques of the Divine Light Mission's Guru Maharaj Ji, which Gallwey said enhanced his powers of concentration in a manner that improved his game.[2] In a 1973 New York Times article he described his discovery of Maharaj Ji and his decision to live in an ashram and practice celibacy.[3] In 1997, Gallwey dedicated his book, The Inner Game of Tennis, to him.[4]<br /><br />The \"inner game\" is based upon certain principles in which an individual uses non-judgmental observations of critical variables, with the purpose of being accurate about these observations. If the observations are accurate, the person's body will adjust and correct automatically to achieve best performance.[5] Gallwey was one of the first to demonstrate a comprehensive method of coaching that could be applied to many situations, and found himself lecturing more often to business leaders in the U.S. than to sports people.[6]<br /><br />Tim Gallwey's work went on to found the current movement in business coaching, life coaching and executive coaching. One of the most well known exponents of business coaching is Sir John Whitmore, who popularised Graham Alexander's and Alan Fine's \"GROW\" model of the coaching process.[6]<br /><br /> In every human endeavor there are two arenas of engagement: the outer and the inner. The outer game is played on an external arena to overcome external obstacles to reach an external goal. The inner game takes place within the mind of the player and is played against such obstacles as fear, self-doubt, lapses in focus, and limiting concepts or assumptions. The inner game is played to overcome the self-imposed obstacles that prevent an individual or team from accessing their full potential.",

He was a close friend of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1069006.C_S__Lewis\" title=\"C.S. Lewis\" rel=\"nofollow\">C.S. Lewis</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9533.Christopher_Tolkien\" title=\"Christopher Tolkien\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christopher Tolkien</a> published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7332.The_Silmarillion\" title=\"The Silmarillion\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silmarillion</a>\n</i>. These, together with <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the word \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings. <br /><br />While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature\u2014or more precisely, high fantasy. Tolkien's writings have inspired many other works of fantasy and have had a lasting effect on the entire field.<br /><br />In 2008, <i>The Times</i> ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". <i>Forbes</i> ranked him the 5th top-earning dead celebrity in 2009.<br /><br /><b>Religious influences</b><br />J.R.R. Tolkien, was born in South Africa in 1892, but his family moved to Britain when he was about 3 years old. When Tolkien was 8 years old, his mother converted to Catholicism, and he remained a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, \u201cI\u2019m a devout Roman Catholic.\u201d <br /><br />Tolkien married his childhood sweetheart, Edith, and they had four children. He wrote them letters each year as if from Santa Claus, and a selection of these was published in 1976 as <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7331.The_Father_Christmas_Letters\" title=\"The Father Christmas Letters\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Father Christmas Letters</a>\n</i>. One of Tolkien\u2019s sons became a Catholic priest. Tolkien was an advisor for the translation of the <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108930.Jerusalem_Bible\" title=\"Jerusalem Bible\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jerusalem Bible</a>\n</i>. <br /><br />Tolkien once described <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> to his friend Robert Murray, an English Jesuit priest, as \"a fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.\" There are many theological themes underlying the narrative including the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of grace. In addition the saga includes themes which incorporate death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. In addition <i>The Lord's Prayer</i> \"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" was reportedly present in Tolkien's mind as he described Frodo's struggles against the power of the \"One Ring.''",

Several of his books, including Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About, allege that both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the pharmaceutical industry value profit over treatments or cures.<br /><br />Trudeau's activities have been the subject of both criminal and civil action. He was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud in the early 1990s, and in 1998 he was sued by U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for making false or misleading claims in infomercials promoting his book The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About. In 2004, he settled that action, by agreeing to pay a $500,000 fine and consenting to a lifetime ban on promoting products other than his books via infomercials. On Nov. 29, 2011, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a $37.6 million fine levied against him for violating that 2004 settlement. Additionally, on remand, the district court modified its final order, requiring that he post a $2 million bond before engaging in future infomercial advertising.<br /><br />On March 17, 2014, Trudeau was sentenced to 10 years in prison stemming from his November 2013 criminal contempt conviction.<br /><br />(Wikipedia)",

Books since her death ghost written by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/145370.Andrew_Neiderman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrew Neiderman</a>, but still attributed to the V.C. Andrews name</b><br /><br />Virginia Cleo Andrews (born Cleo Virginia Andrews) was born June 6, 1923 in Portsmouth, Virginia. The youngest child and the only daughter of William Henry Andrews, a career navy man who opened a tool-and-die business after retirement, and Lillian Lilnora Parker Andrews, a telephone operator. She spent her happy childhood years in Portsmouth, Virginia, living briefly in Rochester, New York. The Andrews family returned to Portsmouth while Virginia was in high school.<br /><br />While a teenager, Virginia suffered a tragic accident, falling down the stairs at her school and incurred severe back injuries. Arthritis and a failed spinal surgical procedure forced her to spend most of her life on crutches or in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Virginia excelled in school and, at fifteen, won a scholarship for writing a parody of Tennyson's <i>Idylls of the King</i>. She proudly earned her diploma from Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth. After graduation, she nurtured her artistic talent by completing a four-year correspondence art course while living at home with her family.<br /><br />After William Andrews died in the late 1960s, Virginia helped to support herself and her mother through her extremely successful career as a commercial artist, portrait painter, and fashion illustrator.<br /><br />Frustrated with the lack of creative satisfaction that her work provided, Virginia sought creative release through writing, which she did in secret. In 1972, she completed her first novel, <i>The Gods of the Green Mountain</i> [sic], a science-fantasy story. It was never published. Between 1972 and 1979, she wrote nine novels and twenty short stories, of which only one was published. \"I Slept with My Uncle on My Wedding Night\", a short fiction piece, was published in a pulp confession magazine.<br /><br />Promise gleamed over the horizon for Virginia when she submitted a 290,000-word novel, <i>The Obsessed</i>, to a publishing company. She was told that the story had potential, but needed to be trimmed and spiced up a bit. She drafted a new outline in a single night and added \"unspeakable things my mother didn't want me to write about.\" The ninety-eight-page revision was re-titled <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> and she was paid a $7,500 advance. Her new-generation Gothic novel reached the bestseller lists a mere two weeks after its 1979 paperback publication by Pocket Books.<br /><br /><i>Petals on the Wind</i>, her sequel to <i>Flowers</i>, was published the next year, earning Virginia a $35,000 advance. The second book remained on the New York Times bestseller list for an unbelievable nineteen weeks (<i>Flowers</i> also returned to the list). These first two novels alone sold over seven million copies in only two years. The third novel of the Dollanganger series, <i>If There Be Thorns</i>, was released in 1981, bringing Virginia a $75,000 advance. It reached No. 2 on many bestseller lists within its first two weeks.<br /><br />Taking a break from the chronicles of Chris and Cathy Dollanganger, Virginia published her one, and only, stand-alone novel, <i>My Sweet Audrina</i>, in 1982. The book welcomed an immediate success, topping the sales figures of her previous novels. Two years later, a fourth Dollanganger novel was released, <i>Seeds of Yesterday</i>. According to the New York Times, <i>Seeds</i> was the best-selling fiction paperback novel of 1984. Also in 1984, V.C. Andrews was named \"Professional Woman of the Year\" by the city of Norfolk, Virginia.<br /><br />Upon Andrews's death in 1986, two final novels\u2014<i>Garden of Shadows</i> and <i>Fallen Hearts</i>\u2014were published. These two novels are considered the last to bear the \"V.C. Andrews\" name and to be almost completely written by",

        "biography": "Hosseini was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1965. In 1970 Hosseini and his family moved to Iran where his father worked for the Embassy of Afghanistan in Tehran. In 1973 Hosseini's family returned to Kabul, and Hosseini's youngest brother was born in July of that year.<br />In 1976, when Hosseini was 11 years old, Hosseini's father obtained a job in Paris, France, and moved the family there. They were unable to return to Afghanistan because of the Saur Revolution in which the PDPA communist party seized power through a bloody coup in April 1978. Instead, a year after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in 1980 they sought political asylum in the United States and made their residence in San Jose, California.<br />Hosseini graduated from Independence High School in San Jose in 1984 and enrolled at Santa Clara University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1988. The following year, he entered the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. in 1993. He completed his residency in internal medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 1996. He practiced medicine for over ten years, until a year and a half after the release of The Kite Runner.<br />Hosseini is currently a Goodwill Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He has been working to provide humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan through the Khaled Hosseini Foundation. The concept for the foundation was inspired by the trip to Afghanistan that Hosseini made in 2007 with UNHCR.<br />He lives in Northern California with his wife, Roya, and their two children (Harris and Farah).",

She obtained a A.B. at Vassar College, then earned a M.F.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. While working towards her doctorate, she also spent a year studying in Iceland as a Fulbright Scholar. From 1981 to 1996, she taught at Iowa State University. Smiley published her first novel, <i>Barn Blind</i>, in 1980, and won a 1985 O. Henry Award for her short story \"Lily\", which was published in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. Her best-selling <i>A Thousand Acres</i>, a story based on William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1992. It was adapted into a film of the same title in 1997. In 1995 she wrote her sole television script produced, for an episode of <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i>. Her novella <i>The Age of Grief</i> was made into the 2002 film <i>The Secret Lives of Dentists</i>.<br /><br /><i>Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel</i> (2005), is a non-fiction meditation on the history and the nature of the novel, somewhat in the tradition of E. M. Forster's seminal <i>Aspects of the Novel</i>, that roams from eleventh century Japan's Murasaki Shikibu's <i>The Tale of Genji</i> to twenty-first century Americans chick lit.<br /><br />In 2001, Smiley was elected a member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters.",

Thucydides has been dubbed the father of \"scientific history\" due to his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis in terms of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work.<br /><br />He has also been called the father of the school of political realism, which views the relations between nations as based on might rather than right. His classical text is still studied at advanced military colleges worldwide, and the Melian dialogue remains a seminal work of international relations theory.<br /><br />More generally, Thucydides showed an interest in developing an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as plague, genocide (as practised against the Melians), and civil war.<br /><br /><i>Excerpted from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</i>",

Along with Protagoras, he forms the first generation of Sophists. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. \"Like other Sophists he was an itinerant, practicing in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to invite miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.\" He has been called \"Gorgias the Nihilist\" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.<br /><br />His chief claim to recognition is that he transplanted rhetoric from his native Sicily to Attica, and contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose.",

She had written all through her infant and junior years and on into her teens, the stories changing from children's adventures to torrid gypsy passions. Her mother used to gather these up from time to time, when her bedroom became too untidy, and dispose of them!<br /><br />Mildred has always wanted to write - which is not to say she has always wanted to be a professional writer. One the contrary, for years She wrote only for her own pleasure, and it wasn't until her husband suggested that she ought to send one of her stories to a publisher that they put several publishers names into a hat and pulled one out. The trouble was, she never used to finish any of the stories, and Caroline, her first published book as Anne Mather, was the first book she'd actually completed. She was newly married then, and her daughter was just a baby, and it was quite a job juggling her household chores and scribbling away in exercise books every chance she got. Not very professional, as you can see, but that's the way it was. The rest as they say in history. And now, more than 160 books later, she's literally - excuse the pun - staggered by what happened. She also published books as Caroline Fleming or Cardine Fleming. Her Anne Mather's novel, Leopard in the Snow, was developed into a 1978 movie.<br /><br />Mildred now has two grown-up children, a son and daughter, and two adorable grandchildren, Abigail and Ben.",

        "biography": "Banville was born in Wexford, Ireland. His father worked in a garage and died when Banville was in his early thirties; his mother was a housewife. He is the youngest of three siblings; his older brother Vincent is also a novelist and has written under the name Vincent Lawrence as well as his own. His sister Vonnie Banville-Evans has written both a children's novel and a reminiscence of growing up in Wexford.<br /><br />Educated at a Christian Brothers' school and at St Peter's College in Wexford. Despite having intended to be a painter and an architect he did not attend university. Banville has described this as \"A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free.\" After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus which allowed him to travel at deeply-discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland he became a sub-editor at the Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor. His first book, Long Lankin, was published in 1970.<br /><br />After the Irish Press collapsed in 1995, he became a sub-editor at the Irish Times. He was appointed literary editor in 1998. The Irish Times, too, suffered severe financial problems, and Banville was offered the choice of taking a redundancy package or working as a features department sub-editor. He left. Banville has been a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books since 1990. In 1984, he was elected to Aosd\u00e1na, but resigned in 2001, so that some other artist might be allowed to receive the cnuas.<br /><br />Banville also writes under the pen name <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/116405.Benjamin_Black\" title=\"Benjamin Black\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benjamin Black</a>. His first novel under this pen name was Christine Falls, which was followed by The Silver Swan in 2007. Banville has two adult sons with his wife, the American textile artist Janet Dunham. They met during his visit to San Francisco in 1968 where she was a student at the University of California, Berkeley. Dunham described him during the writing process as being like \"a murderer who's just come back from a particularly bloody killing\". Banville has two daughters from his relationship with Patricia Quinn, former head of the Arts Council of Ireland.<br /><br />Banville has a strong interest in vivisection and animal rights, and is often featured in Irish media speaking out against vivisection in Irish university research.",

There are forests, castles, and lords or kings, minstrels, tinkers and wizards. Her writing usually puts her characters in situations involving mysterious powers that they don't understand. Many of her characters aren't even sure of their own ancestry. Music often plays an important role. Love between family members is also important in McKillip's writing, although members of her families often disagree.",

Snyder is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Since the 1970s, he has frequently been described as the 'laureate of Deep Ecology'. From the 1950s on, he has published travel-journals and essays from time to time. His work in his various roles reflects his immersion in both Buddhist spirituality and nature. Snyder has also translated literature into English from ancient Chinese and modern Japanese. As a social critic, Snyder has much in common with Lewis Mumford, Aldous Huxley, Karl Hess, Aldo Leopold, and Karl Polanyi. Snyder was for many years on the faculty of the University of California, Davis, and for a time served on the California Arts Council.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br /><i>Gary Snyder.

        "biography": "Theodor Seuss Geisel was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, MA. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vaction in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During WW II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published The Cat in the Hat, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was Green Eggs and Ham. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name:<br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/398177.Theo_Le_Sieg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theo Le Sieg</a>",

        "biography": "Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.<br /><br />Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.<br /><br />Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.<br />",

        "biography": "Susan Beth Pfeffer was born in New York City in 1948. She grew up in the city and its nearby suburbs and spent summers in the Catskill Mountains. When she was six her father wrote and published a book on constitutional law, and Pfeffer decided that she, too, wanted to be a writer. That year she wrote her first story, about the love between an Oreo cookie and a pair of scissors. However, it wasn't until 1970 that her first book, Just Morgan, was published. She wrote it during her last semester at New York University; since then, she has been a full-time writer for young people. <br /><br />She has won numerous awards and citations for her work, which range from picture books to middle-grade and young-adult novels, and include both contemporary and historical fiction. She is also the author of the popular Portraits of Little Women series for grades 3-6, and has written a book for adults on writing for children.<br /><br />To date, she has written more than 60 books. About David was awarded the South Carolina Young Adult Book Award. The Year Without Michael is an ALA Best Book for Young Adults and winner of the South Carolina Young Adult Book Award; it was also named by the American Library Association as one of the hundred best books for teenagers written between 1968-1993. <br /><br />When she is not working, she enjoys watching movies, both new and old, and collecting movie memorabilia, reading biographies and histories, and eating foods that are bad for her. She lives in Middletown, New York, with her two cats, Alexander and Emily.<br /><br />Named the American Library Associations Young Adult Library Services Association Best Book for Young Adults 2007 and Teens\u2019 Top Ten Booklist in 2007.

He is best known as the host of Comedy Central\u2019s <i>The Daily Show</i> and for his political satire.<br /><br /><i>Librarian Note: There is more than one author in the GoodReads database with this name. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/similar_names/466.Jon_Stewart\" rel=\"nofollow\">See authors with similar names here.</a></i> <br /><br />Stewart started as a stand-up comedian, but later branched out to television, hosting <i>Short Attention Span Theater</i> for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on MTV, called <i>The Jon Stewart Show</i>, and then hosted another show on MTV called You Wrote It, You Watch It.<br /><br />Stewart became the host of <i>The Daily Show</i> on Comedy Central in early 1999. He is also a writer and co-producer of the show. After Stewart joined, <i>The Daily Show</i> steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim leading to his first Emmy Award in 2001. Stewart himself has also gained significant notoriety as a vocal, outspoken critic of the Bush administration and of personality-driven media shows, in particular Bill O'Reilly and the Fox News Channel. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his \"mock news\" desk. However the validity of this distinction is challenged by a number of critics, researchers, and even supporters, some of whom have awarded <i>The Daily Show</i> with news and journalism awards.<br /><br />Stewart co-wrote <i>America (The Book)</i>, which was one of the top fifteen best-sellers in the US in 2004. Stewart hosted the 78th Academy Awards and the 80th Academy Awards.",

        "biography": "<br />Paul West (February 23, 1930) was an English-born novelist, literary historian and poet, the author of 24 novels, who lived in America since the early 1960s. He resided in upstate New York with his wife, the writer, poet and well-known naturalist Diane Ackerman, until his death in 2015. Paul, still remembered with affection by his old colleagues and friends in England as a big, jolly man, was born in Eckington, which is near (and now considered a part of) Sheffield in South Yorkshire, but was during West\u2019s childhood a Derbyshire village associated with the famous literary Sitwells of Renishaw. <br />Paul was honoured with the American Academy of Arts and Letters Literature Award (1985), the Lannan Prize for Fiction (1993), the Grand Prix Halperine-Kaminsky Award (1993), and three Pushcart Prizes (1987, 1991, 2003). He was also a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a New York Public Library Literary Lion (1987), and a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters 1996, France).<br />His parents, Alfred and Mildred, really cared for books, and created an environment which ensured that young Paul inherited a great passion for literature, which was enhanced when he went from his native village to study first at Oxford University in England and later at Columbia University in America. He never lived in England again after going to Columbia, and in later years Paul was involved with other US universities in teaching roles, notably Pennsylvania State University. <br />Paul West\u2019s novels have included: \u2018A Quality of Mercy\u2019 (1961); \u2018Tenement of Clay\u2019 (1965); \u2018Alley Jaggers\u2019 (1966); \u2018I'm Expecting to Live Quite Soon\u2019 (1970); \u2018Bela Lugosi's White Christmas\u2019 (1972); \u2018The Very Rich Hours of Count von Stauffenberg\u2019 (1980); \u2018Rat Man of Paris\u2019 (1986); \u2018The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper\u2019 (1991); and \u2018OK: The Corral, the Earps and Doc Holliday\u2019 (2000). <br />His non-fiction has included the autobiographical \u2018I, Said the Sparrow\u2019, a delightful essay on his Eckington childhood; \u2018The Growth of the Novel\u2019 (1959), \u2018The Modern Novel\u2019 (in 2 vols, 1963); \u2018Robert Penn Warren\u2019 (1964); \u2018Words for a Deaf Daughter\u2019 (1969); \u2018A Stroke of Genius: Illness and Self-discovery\u2019 (1995); and the remarkable \u2018The Shadow Factory\u2019 (2008), the aphasic memoir he dictated with such struggle and resolve \u2013it brings tears to the eyes and admiration to the heart, as we are reminded in reading it of the courage of this man. It is a \u2018must-read\u2019 in the context of the terrible stroke he suffered in 2003. Paul\u2019s wife, Diane, also wrote about that stroke and its consequences in her book \u2018One Hundred Names for Love: A Stroke, a Marriage and the Language of Healing\u2019. Paul\u2019s poetry collections include \u2018Poems\u2019 (1952), \u2018The Spellbound Horses\u2019 (1960), and \u2018The Snow Leopard\u2019 (1964).<br /><br /><br /><i>Librarian Note: There is more than one author in the GoodReads database with this name.</i>",

In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero. <br />He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book <i>The Prophet</i>, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. <br />Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Lao-Tzu.",

        "biography": "<i>There is more than one author with this Name.</i><br /><br />Felix Salten was an Austrian writer. He was born Siegmund Salzmann in Budapest, Hungary. When he was three weeks old, his family moved to Vienna, Austria. Many Jews were immigrating into the city in the late 19th century because Vienna had finally granted full citizenship to Jews in 1867.<br /><br />When his father went bankrupt, Felix had to quit school and begin working in an insurance agency. He also began submitting poems and book reviews to journals. He became part of the Young Vienna movement (Jung Wien) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic in the Vienna press. In 1901 he founded Vienna's first, short-lived literary cabaret. In 1900 he published his first collection of short stories. He was soon publishing, on an average, one book a year, of plays, short stories, novels, travel books, and essay collections. He also wrote for nearly all the major newspapers of Vienna. He wrote film scripts and librettos for operettas. In 1927 he became president of the Austrian P.E.N. club.<br /><br />His most famous work is <i>Bambi</i>, which he wrote in 1923. It was translated into English in 1928 and became a Book-of-the-Month Club hit. In 1933, he sold the film rights to Sidney Franklin for $1,000, who later transferred the rights to the Walt Disney studios. Disney released its movie based on <i>Bambi</i> in 1942.<br /><br />Life in Austria became perilous for a prominent Jew in the 1930s. Adolf Hitler had Salten's books banned in 1936. Two years later (1938), after Austria had become part of Germany, Salten moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where he lived until his death.<br /><br />He was married to the actress Ottilie Metzl, and had two children: Paul and Anna-Katherina. He wrote another book based on the character Bambi, titled <i>Bambi's Children: The Story of a Forest Family</i>, 1939. His stories \"Perri\" and \"The Hound of Florence\" inspired the Disney films <i>Perri</i> and <i>The Shaggy Dog</i>.<br /><br />Salten is considered to be the author of the erotic novel <i>Josephine Mutzenbacher</i>, the fictional autobiography of a Vienna prostitute, which was published in 1906.<br />",

        "biography": "Madeleine L'Engle was an American writer best known for her young adult fiction, particularly the Newbery Medal-winning <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> and its sequels <i>A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> and <i>Many Waters</i>. Her works reflect her strong interest in modern science: tesseracts, for example, are featured prominently in <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, mitochondrial DNA in <i>A Wind in the Door</i>, organ regeneration in <i>The Arm of the Starfish</i>, and so forth.<br /><br />\"Madeleine was born on November 29th, 1918, and spent her formative years in New York City. Instead of her school work, she found that she would much rather be writing stories, poems and journals for herself, which was reflected in her grades (not the best). However, she was not discouraged.<br /><br />At age 12, she moved to the French Alps with her parents and went to an English boarding school where, thankfully, her passion for writing continued to grow. She flourished during her high school years back in the United States at Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, vacationing with her mother in a rambling old beach cottage on a beautiful stretch of Florida beach.<br /><br />She went to Smith College and studied English with some wonderful teachers as she read the classics and continued her own creative writing. She graduated with honors and moved into a Greenwich Village apartment in New York. She worked in the theater, where Equity union pay and a flexible schedule afforded her the time to write! She published her first two novels during these years\u2014<i>A Small Rain</i> and <i>Ilsa</i>\u2014before meeting Hugh Franklin, her future husband, when she was an understudy in Anton Chekov's <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. They married during <i>The Joyous Season</i>.<br /><br />She had a baby girl and kept on writing, eventually moving to Connecticut to raise the family away from the city in a small dairy farm village with more cows than people. They bought a dead general store, and brought it to life for 9 years. They moved back to the city with three children, and Hugh revitalized his professional acting career. The family has kept the country house, Crosswicks, and continues to spend summers there.<br /><br />As the years passed and the children grew, Madeleine continued to write and Hugh to act, and they to enjoy each other and life. Madeleine began her association with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where she has been the librarian and maintained an office for more than thirty years. After Hugh's death in 1986, it was her writing and lecturing that kept her going. She has now lived through the 20th century and into the 21st and has written over 60 books and keeps writing. She enjoys being with her friends, her children, her grandchildren, and her great grandchildren.\"<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/madeleinelengle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/author/madele...</a><br /><br />Copyright \u00a9 2007 Crosswicks, Ltd.

        "biography": "Beverly Cleary (born April 12, 1916) is the author of over 30 books for young adults and children. Her characters are normal children facing challenges that many of us face growing up, and her stories are liberally laced with humour. Some of her best known and loved characters are Ramona Quimby and her sister Beatrice (\"Beezus\"), Henry Huggins, and Ralph S. Mouse.<br /><br />Beverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn in McMinnville, Oregon. When she was 6, her family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she went to grammar and high school. She was slow in learning to read, due partly to her dissatisfaction with the books she was required to read and partly to an unpleasant first grade teacher. It wasn't until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books, when she started reading The Dutch Twins by Lucy Fitch Perkins. Thereafter, she was a frequent visitor to the library, though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read \u2014 those about children like herself.<br /><br />She moved to California to attend the University of California, Berkeley, and after graduation with a B.A in English in 1938, studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939. Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima, Washington, where she met many children who were searching for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself. In response, she wrote her first book, Henry Huggins, which was published in 1950. Beezus and Ramona, Cleary's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story, was published in 1955, although Beezus and Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins series as supporting characters.<br /><br />In 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland, California. The Clearys became parents to a set of twins, Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James, in 1955. Clarence Cleary died in 2004. Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel, California.<br /><br />She has also written two autobiographies, A Girl from Yamhill and My Own Two Feet.",

He worked in the statistics department of the London office of Standard Oil for eighteen years while struggling to bring up a family, but nevertheless found enough time to write, and, in 1908, through the efforts of Sir Henry Newbolt he received a Civil List pension which enabled him to concentrate on writing;<br /><br />One of de la Mare's special interests was the imagination, and this contributed both to the popularity of his children's writing and to his other work occasionally being taken less seriously than it deserved.<br /><br />De la Mare also wrote some subtle psychological horror stories; \"Seaton's Aunt\" and \"Out of the Deep\" are noteworthy examples. His 1921 novel, <i>Memoirs of a Midget</i>, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.<br />",

Born in 1901 to a Chinese merchant family in Rajburi, a town to the west of Bangkok, she was the eldest of five children \u2014 or, counting her father's children by a second wife, the eldest of eight. Her mother was a very religious woman and taught her the rudiments of Buddhist practice, such as nightly chants and the observance of the precepts, from an early age. In later life she described how, at the age of six, she became so filled with fear and loathing at the miseries her mother went through in being pregnant and giving birth to a younger sibling that, on seeing the newborn child for the first time \u2014 \"sleeping quietly, a little red thing with black, black hair\" \u2014 she ran away from home for three days. This experience, plus the anguish she must have felt when her parents separated, probably lay behind her decision, made when she was still quite young, never to submit to what she saw as the slavery of marriage.<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/kee/dynamic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/th...</a><br /><br />",

Out of college I did temporary work in offices and libraries, while at night, I wrote poetry and made strange life forms from cloth. When I teamed up with a puppeteer, Bob Kaminski (my husband), I was able to bring my cloth creations to life. We began performing on the streets of San Francisco, at Renaissance fairs, and at schools. After attending a workshop on Balinese shadow puppetry, we traveled to Bali and Java to learn ancient techniques from modern masters, and we adapted material from American folklore to the shadow screen. I became so fascinated by the power of ancient myth and folktale to engage a modern audience that I enrolled in the Folklore and Mythology Program at UCLA, where I received my Ph.D. While I was a student there, I attended a talk by the author-illustrator Uri Shulevitz, and heard him say that a picture book is like a small theater. A puppet theater is also a small theater, I thought. I can do that! My first children's books were adaptations of folktales, and soon, I was able to incorporate my lifelong habit of writing poetry into my work.<br /><br />Currently (2018), I live in Portland, Oregon, with my husband. I divide my writing time between children's books and a long term project on folktales, grandmothers and cultural evolution.<br />",

        "biography": "A native of the Detroit area, Marcia Muller grew up in a house full of books and self-published three copies of her first novel at age twelve, a tale about her dog complete with primitive illustrations. The \"reviews\" were generally positive.<br /><br />In the early 1970s, having moved to California, Muller found herself unemployable and began experimenting with mystery novels.<br /><br />In the ensuing thirty-some years, Muller has authored over 35 novels--three of them in collaboration with husband <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22880.Bill_Pronzini\" title=\"Bill Pronzini\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bill Pronzini</a>--seven short-story collections, and numerous nonfiction articles. Together she and Pronzini have edited a dozen anthologies and a nonfiction book on the mystery genre. Muller received the Shamus Award, \"The Eye\" (Lifetime achievement award) in 1993. In 2005 Muller was named a Grand Master by <a href=\"http://www.mysterywriters.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystery Writers of America</a>, the organization's highest award. Pronzini was named Grand Master in 2008, making them the only living couple to share the award (the other being Margaret Millar and Ross Macdonald). The Mulzinis, as friends call them, live in Sonoma County, California, in yet another house full of books.<br /><br />",

        "biography": "<b>Charles John Huffam Dickens</b> was a writer and social critic who created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.<br /><br />Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.<br /><br />Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers\u2014from Leo Tolstoy to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3706.George_Orwell\" title=\"George Orwell\" rel=\"nofollow\">George Orwell</a> and G. K. Chesterton\u2014for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<br /><br />On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on <i>Edwin Drood.</i> He never regained consciousness, and the next day he died at Gad's Hill Place. Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner,\" he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads: \"To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.\" His last words were: \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.<br /><br />(from Wikipedia)",

        "biography": "Fantasy, alternate-history and science fiction writer Thomas Harlan is the author of the critically acclaimed Oath of Empire series from Tor Books. He has been twice nominated for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Author (in 1999 and 2000). In May of 2001, he received the SF^2 Award for Best New Fantasy Author. His first novel, The Shadow of Ararat was selected as one of the Barnes &amp; Noble Top 20 Best SF&amp;F Novels of 1999. The sequel, Gate of Fire, was chosen as both a B&amp;N Top 20 book and placed on Locus Magazine\u2019s Recommended Reading list for the year 2000. The third and fourth Oath of Empire novels, The Storm of Heaven and The Dark Lord were released in May of 2001 and 2002. A new series followed the cataclysmic end of Oath; an alternate-history science-fiction archaeological/combat series called In the time of the Sixth Sun. The first book, Wasteland of Flint, was published in 2003 and received a starred review in Kirkus. House of Reeds followed in 2004, and Land of the Dead in 2009.<br /><br />Thomas has published a variety of very well received short fiction in Dragon magazine, as well as the largest adventure module ever published in Dungeon. <br /><br />Twenty years of game design have produced a number of play-by-email systems, of which the long-running and increasingly complex Lords of the Earth is the best known. Lords is a historical simulation game, encompassing the whole of the Earth, modeling political, economic and military conflict from the early Iron Age to the late 1800\u2019s. There are over forty Lords of the Earth campaigns currently in progress, in English, Spanish, and Italian. The initial campaign has been running for over twenty years and has chronicled the period from 1000 AD to 1770 AD. Lords of the Earth was nominated for an Origins/GAMA award for Best PBM Game of the Year in 2003.<br /><br />Thomas was born in Tucson, Arizona on February 25th, 1964. He was raised by archaeologist \u2013 dendrochronologist \u2013 botanist parents and traveled widely throughout the American southwest and overseas as a result. A steady diet of Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings), Herbert (Dune), Herge (Tintin), Goscinny &amp; Uderzo (Asterix), John Buchan (Greenmantle, The Thirty-Nine Steps, etc.), Talbot Mundy (The Nine Unknown, Jimgrim, King of the Khyber Rifles), Edgar Rice Burroughs (John Carter of Mars), Kenneth Bulmer (Prescot of Scorpio) and other purveyors of the fantastic inform his literary background. An excessively long stay in college provided him with a moderate background in creative writing, history, art and other sundry skills helpful to a novelist.<br /><br />Aside from his literary career, Thomas spent too many years in the information technology industry as a developer, manager and architect for government, education and healthcare. He currently lives in Salem, Oregon.",

In October 2011 he released his fifth book, a biography of Walter Payton titled, \"Sweetness: The Enigmatic Life of Walter Payton.\" It spent four weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.<br /><br />Pearlman was born and raised in Mahopac, New York. He got his start in journalism in 1989, when he interned at a weekly newspaper in Cross River, entitled \"The Patent Trader\". After graduating from the University of Delaware, he was hired as a food and fashion writer by The Tennessean in Nashville. In 1996, Pearlman was hired by Sports Illustrated, where he spent nearly seven years as a baseball writer.<br /><br />In 2002, Pearlman left Sports Illustrated and spent the next two years at Newsday, but left to focus on writing books. He also keeps an unusually personal online blog, where he posts a weekly Q&amp;A series, The Quaz, with athletes, politicians, actors, singers and many random people. <br /><br />He was a frequent contributor to ESPN.com's Page 2, then as a columnist for SI.com. No stranger to controversy, Pearlman used his own website as a forum to call out the overzealous missionary goals of Tim Tebow's father as \"pretty evil.\" In the fall of 2007, Pearlman wrote several controversial articles on Page 2 regarding the lack of a rivalry between the University of Delaware's and Delaware State University's football teams. The University of Delaware and Delaware State finally played a football game on November 23, 2007 at part of the NCAA Division I FCS playoffs. Delaware won the game with a score of 44\u20137.<br />",

Ha escrito varios libros de ensayo sobre el hombre en la crisis de nuestro tiempo y sobre el sentido de la actividad literaria \u2014as\u00ed, <i>El escritor y sus fantasmas</i>, <i>Apolog\u00edas y rechazos</i>, <i>Uno y el Universo</i> y <i>La resistencia</i>\u2014, su autobiograf\u00eda, <i>Antes del fin</i>, y tres novelas: <i>El t\u00fanel</i>, <i>Sobre h\u00e9roes y tumbas</i> y <i>Abadd\u00f3n, el exterminador</i>. Escritores tan dispares como Camus, Greene y Thomas Mann, como Quasimodo y Piovene, como Gombrowicz y Nadeau han escrito con admiraci\u00f3n sobre su obra, que ha obtenido el Premio Cervantes, el Premio Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, el Premio Jerusal\u00e9n y la Medalla de Oro del C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid.<br /><br />Ernesto Sabato was an Argentine writer, painter and physicist. According to the BBC he \"won some of the most prestigious prizes in Hispanic literature\" and \"became very influential in the literary world throughout Latin America\". Upon his death El Pa\u00eds dubbed him the \"last classic writer in Argentine literature\".<br /><br />Sabato was born in Rojas, a small town in Buenos Aires Province. Sabato began his studies at the Colegio Nacional de La Plata. He then studied physics at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where he earned a Ph.D. He then attended the Sorbonne in Paris and worked at the Curie Institute. After World War II, he lost faith in science and started writing.<br /><br />Sabato's oeuvre includes three novels: El T\u00fanel (1948), Sobre h\u00e9roes y tumbas (1961) and Abadd\u00f3n el exterminador (1974). The first of these received critical acclaim upon its publication from, among others, fellow writers Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. The second is regarded as his masterpiece, though he nearly burnt it like many of his other works. Sabato's essays cover topics as diverse as metaphysics, politics and tango. His writings led him to receive many international prizes, including the Legion of Honour (France), the Prix M\u00e9dicis (Italy) and the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (Spain).",

These epics lie at the beginning of the Western canon of literature, and have had an enormous influence on the history of literature.<br /><br />When he lived is unknown. Herodotus estimates that Homer lived 400 years before his own time, which would place him at around 850 BCE, while other ancient sources claim that he lived much nearer to the supposed time of the Trojan War, in the early 12th century BCE. Most modern researchers place Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BCE.<br /><br />The formative influence of the Homeric epics in shaping Greek culture was widely recognized, and Homer was described as the teacher of Greece. Homer's works, which are about fifty percent speeches, provided models in persuasive speaking and writing that were emulated throughout the ancient and medieval Greek worlds. Fragments of Homer account for nearly half of all identifiable Greek literary papyrus finds.",

        "biography": "An eternal daydreamer and sometimes writer, Carmen Bellaire has always been lost in the worlds of his imagination. When he discovered role-playing games for the first time, it was love at first read. In short order he collected together his brothers and friends, and began to weave them stories of action, adventure and intrigue. Carmen started with the first edition rules of Heroes Unlimited\u2122, as comics were a big draw for him. However, he soon added the original Robotech\u00ae RPG, first edition Palladium Fantasy RPG\u00ae and The Mechanoids\u00ae to his library of Palladium role-playing games.<br /><br />Carmen ran adventure after lengthy adventure for his buddies, even when they all entered the Canadian Army Reserves together. His collection of Palladium role-playing game products continued to grow and went with him onto GMT (general military training), where he continued to run adventures on base.<br /><br />In time, Carmen grew up and got married to his high-school sweetheart Christina \u2013 who he met in GMT! He drifted through a succession of construction and labor jobs before becoming a professional truck driver. Christina and Carmen had a beautiful daughter, Robyn; bought a house and settled down. But through all of it, he had his role-playing games and imaginary worlds, sometimes writing them down.<br /><br />For years, some of his players had encouraged Carmen to submit some of his ideas to Palladium. When he finally worked up the nerve he was pleasantly surprised that publisher Kevin Siembieda loved them. When he had the chance to submit some of his ideas for possible publication, Carmen jumped at the opportunity. The next thing Carmen knew, he had written the popular Powers Unlimited\u2122 1, 2 and 3 sourcebooks for Heroes Unlimited\u2122, the Splicers\u00ae RPG, Rifts\u00ae Merc Ops, Rifts\u00ae Mercenary Sourcebook, and Rifts\u00ae Dimension Book\u2122 8: Naruni\u2122 Wave Two, as well as contributed to a handful of other titles, including Rifts\u00ae Ultimate Edition.<br /><br />Carmen sometimes laments that he has far too many hobbies for his own good, including writing short stories, novels and RPG material; role-playing, miniature wargaming, motorcycling, home renovation, and medieval reenacting (the SCA). Despite his wide range of interests and a family, Carmen continues to find time to work on new books for the various Palladium Books\u00ae game lines.",

        "biography": "Alexis-Charles-Henri Cl\u00e9rel de Tocqueville (July 29, 1805 \u2013 April 16, 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these works, he explored the effects of the rising equality of social conditions on the individual and the state in western societies.<br /><br />Democracy in America (1835), his major work, published after his travels in the United States, is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. An eminent representative of the classical liberal political tradition, Tocqueville was an active participant in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848) and then during the Second Republic (1849\u20131851) which succeeded to the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's December 2, 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution, Volume I. After obtaining a law degree, Alexis de Tocqueville was named auditor-magistrate at the court of Versailles. There, he met Gustave de Beaumont, a prosecutor substitute, who collaborated with him on various literary works. Both were sent to the United States to study the penitentiary system. During this trip, they wrote Du syst\u00e8me p\u00e9nitentiaire aux Etats-Unis et de son application (1832). Back in France, Tocqueville became a lawyer. He met the English economist Nassau William Senior in 1833, and they became good friends and corresponded for many years.[1] He published his master-work, De la d\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique, in 1835. The success of this work, an early model for the science that would become known as sociology, led him to be named chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) in 1837, and to be elected the next year to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques. In 1841 he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.<br /><br />Tocqueville, who despised the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848), began his political career in the same period. Thus, he became deputy of the Manche department (Valognes), a position which he maintained until 1851. In parliament, he defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade, while supporting the colonization of Algeria carried on by Louis-Philippe's regime. Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of the Manche in 1842, and became the president of the department's conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral between 1849 and 1851.<br /><br />Apart from Canada, Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England, producing Memoir on Pauperism. In 1841 and 1846, he traveled to Algeria. His first travel inspired his Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, in which he criticized the French model of colonization, based on an assimilationist view, preferring instead the British model of indirect rule, which did not mix different populations together. He went as far as openly advocating racial segregation between the European colonists and the \"Arabs\" through the implementation of two different legislative systems (a half century before its effective implementation with the 1881 Indigenous code).<br /><br />After the fall of the July Monarchy during the February 1848 Revolution, Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, where he became a member of the Commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the Second Republic (1848\u20131851). He defended bicameralism (two parliamentary chambers) and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the laboring population of Paris, universal suffrage was conceived as a means to block the revolutionary spirit of Paris.<br /><br />During the Second Republic, Tocqueville sided with the parti de l'Ordre against the \"socialists\" and workers. A few days after the February insurrection, he believed a violent clash between the workers' population agitating in favor of a \"Democratic and Social Republic\" and",

His writings on power, knowledge, and discourse have been widely influential in academic circles. In the 1960s Foucault was associated with structuralism, a movement from which he distanced himself. Foucault also rejected the poststructuralist and postmodernist labels later attributed to him, preferring to classify his thought as a critical history of modernity rooted in Immanuel Kant. Foucault's project was particularly influenced by Nietzsche, his \"genealogy of knowledge\" being a direct allusion to Nietzsche's \"genealogy of morality\". In a late interview he definitively stated: \"I am a Nietzschean.\"<br /><br />Foucault was listed as the most cited scholar in the humanities in 2007 by the ISI Web of Science.",

Hill's works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. He became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1936. \"What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve\" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions. How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach of the average person, were the focal points of Hill's books.",

        "biography": "I was born illegitimately in 1933 in South Africa and spent my early childhood years in a small town deep in the heart of the Lebombo mountains.<br /><br />It was a somewhat isolated community and I grew up among farm folk and the African people. At the age of five I was sent to a boarding school which might be better described as a combination orphanage and reform school, where I learned to box - though less as a sport and more as a means to stay alive.<br /><br />But I survived to return to a small mountain town named Barberton in the North Eastern part of the country.<br /><br />Here I met Doc, a drunken German music teacher who spent the next few years filling my young mind with the wonders of nature as we roamed the high mountains. His was the best education I was ever to receive, despite the scholarship I won to a prestigious boy's school and thereafter to a university in England where I studied Journalism.<br /><br />I came to Australia because I was banned from returning to my own country.<br /><br />This was due to the fact that I had started a weekend school for Africans in the school hall of the prestigious boy's school I attended.<br /><br />One day the school hall was raided by the police who then branded me a Communist as they considered educating Africans a subversive act.<br /><br />While studying journalism, I met a wonderful Australian girl.<br /><br />\"Come to my country!\" Benita invited.<br /><br />I did, and soon after arriving in Australia, married her. Benita gave me three splendid sons, Brett, Adam and Damon. Brett, who married Ann has given me three lovely grandsons, Ben now 14, Jake is about to turn 12 and Marcus is almost 6 years old.<br /><br />I have lived all my Australian life in Sydney (the nicest place on earth) and, until I started writing fiction, made my career in advertising working as a copywriter and creative director.<br /><br />At the age of 55 I decided to take the plunge. I had been telling stories since the age of five and had always known I would be a writer some day, though life kept getting in the way until I realised that it was either now or never.<br /><br />Bryce Courtenay died at his home in Canberra, Australia. He was 79.<br /><br />Courtenay is survived by his second wife Christine Gee and his children Adam and Brett.",

She and her three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth and May were educated by their father, philosopher/ teacher, Bronson Alcott and raised on the practical Christianity of their mother, Abigail May.<br /><br />Louisa spent her childhood in Boston and in Concord, Massachusetts, where her days were enlightened by visits to Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s library, excursions into nature with Henry David Thoreau and theatricals in the barn at Hillside (now Hawthorne\u2019s \"Wayside\").<br /><br />Like her character, Jo March in Little Women, young Louisa was a tomboy: \"No boy could be my friend till I had beaten him in a race,\" she claimed, \" and no girl if she refused to climb trees, leap fences....\"<br /><br />For Louisa, writing was an early passion. She had a rich imagination and often her stories became melodramas that she and her sisters would act out for friends. Louisa preferred to play the \"lurid\" parts in these plays, \"the villains, ghosts, bandits, and disdainful queens.\"<br /><br />At age 15, troubled by the poverty that plagued her family, she vowed: \"I will do something by and by. Don\u2019t care what, teach, sew, act, write, anything to help the family; and I\u2019ll be rich and famous and happy before I die, see if I won\u2019t!\"<br /><br />Confronting a society that offered little opportunity to women seeking employment, Louisa determined \"...I will make a battering-ram of my head and make my way through this rough and tumble world.\" Whether as a teacher, seamstress, governess, or household servant, for many years Louisa did any work she could find.<br /><br />Louisa\u2019s career as an author began with poetry and short stories that appeared in popular magazines. In 1854, when she was 22, her first book Flower Fables was published. A milestone along her literary path was Hospital Sketches (1863) based on the letters she had written home from her post as a nurse in Washington, DC as a nurse during the Civil War.<br /><br />When Louisa was 35 years old, her publisher Thomas Niles in Boston asked her to write \"a book for girls.\" Little Women was written at Orchard House from May to July 1868. The novel is based on Louisa and her sisters\u2019 coming of age and is set in Civil War New England. Jo March was the first American juvenile heroine to act from her own individuality; a living, breathing person rather than the idealized stereotype then prevalent in children\u2019s fiction.<br /><br />In all, Louisa published over 30 books and collections of stories. She died on March 6, 1888, only two days after her father, and is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord.",

Brooks (January 9, 1886 \u2013<br />August 17, 1958) was an American writer best remembered for his short stories and children's books, particularly those about Freddy the Pig and other anthropomorphic animal inhabitants of the \"Bean farm\" in upstate New York.<br /><br />Born in Rome, New York, Brooks attended college at the University of Rochester and subsequently studied homeopathic medicine in New York City. He dropped out after two years, however, and returned to Rochester, where he married his first wife, Anne Shepard, in 1909. Brooks found employment with an advertising agency in Utica, and then \"retired\" in 1911, evidently because he came into a considerable inheritance. His retirement was not permanent: in 1917, he went to work for the American Red Cross and later did editorial work for several magazines, including The New Yorker. <br /><br />In 1940, Brooks turned to his own writing for his full-time occupation. Walter married his second wife, Dorothy Collins, following the death of Anne in 1952. <br /><br />The first works Brooks published were poems and short stories. His short story \"Ed Takes the Pledge\" about a talking horse was the basis for the 1960s television comedy series Mister Ed (credit for creating the characters is given in each episode to \"Walter Brooks\"). His most enduring works, however, are the 26 books he wrote about Freddy the Pig and his friends.<br /><br />Source: &lt; a h r e f = \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_R._Brooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_R...</a> \" &gt;m y l i n k t e x t <br />a &gt;",

He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death. He is primarily known for a series of major novels in which he portrayed the encounter of America with Europe. His plots centered on personal relationships, the proper exercise of power in such relationships, and other moral questions. His method of writing from the point of view of a character within a tale allowed him to explore the phenomena of consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting.<br />James insisted that writers in Great Britain and America should be allowed the greatest freedom possible in presenting their view of the world, as French authors were. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and unreliable narrators in his own novels and tales brought a new depth and interest to realistic fiction, and foreshadowed the modernist work of the twentieth century. An extraordinarily productive writer, in addition to his voluminous works of fiction he published articles and books of travel writing, biography, autobiography, and criticism,and wrote plays, some of which were performed during his lifetime with moderate success. His theatrical work is thought to have profoundly influenced his later novels and tales.",

        "biography": "Herodotus was an ancient Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus, Caria (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BCE (c. 484\u2013425 BCE). He has been called \"The Father of History\", as well as \"The Father of Lies.\" He was the first historian known to collect his materials systematically, test their accuracy to a certain extent, and arrange them in a well-constructed and vivid narrative. The Histories\u2014his masterpiece and the only work he is known to have produced\u2014is a record of his \"inquiry\" (or \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 histor\u00eda, a word that passed into Latin and acquired its modern meaning of \"history\"), being an investigation of the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars and including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Although some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate, he claimed he was reporting only what had been told to him. Little is known of his personal history.<br /><br />It was not until the time of Herodotus that gods began to have less influence upon history that was written, yet it was still implied because of the largely accepted view of the Greeks and the expectations that they may have had of how The Histories would be written. History was becoming more of a \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than an amusement. Because of Herodotus wanting people to accept what he had to write, he implemented stories that may have not directly correlated to gods, but rather implemented the idea that miracles or supernatural events took place. As was the story of Arion and the dolphin. While on a boat the men found out that Arion, who was a musician, was worth lots of money and decided to have him killed. The crew gave him two options, that either he jump ship or they kill him on the spot. Arion flung himself into the water and a dolphin carried him to shore.<br /><br />Herodotus was more concerned with putting pleasure before knowledge, unless he did not believe that the gods had a dramatic influence on history and was rather just trying to please his audience. Like the story of the king having his servant look upon his naked wife, and when spotting him hiding, asked him to kill her husband.[78] This, like many stories of Herodotus, are told in great detail, and for the simplicity of dramatic effect. This refers back to the way bards used to tell their poems or stories to their audience. Herodotus was accused by many because of such detailed accounts, and even called a liar by some. In his writing we can already see that there was no direct association with gods.",

        "biography": "<b>Marguerite Donnadieu</b>, better known as <b>Marguerite Duras</b> (pronounced [ma\u0280g\u0259\u0281it dy\u02c8\u0281as] in French) (April 4, 1914 \u2013 March 3, 1996) was a French writer and film director.<br /><br />She was born at Gia-Dinh, near Saigon, French Indochina (now Vietnam), after her parents responded to a campaign by the French government encouraging people to work in the colony.<br /><br />Marguerite's father fell ill soon after their arrival, and returned to France, where he died. After his death, her mother, a teacher, remained in Indochina with her three children. The family lived in relative poverty after a bad investment in an isolated property and area of farmland in Cambodia(t\u00eate de pisse). The difficult life that the family experienced during this period was highly influential on Marguerite's later work.<br /><br />At 17, Marguerite went to France, her parents' native country, where she began studying for a degree in mathematics. This she soon abandoned to concentrate on political sciences, and then law. After completing her studies, she became an active member of the PCF (the French Communist Party) and was engaged in the resistance.<br /><br />In 1943 she changed her surname to \"Duras\" for Duras, the name of a village in the Lot-et-Garonne d\u00e9partement, where her father's house was located.<br /><br />She is the author of a great many novels, plays, films, interviews and short narratives, including her best-selling, apparently autobiographical work L'Amant (1984), translated into English as The Lover. This text won the Goncourt prize in 1984. The story of her adolescence also appears in three other forms: The Sea Wall, Eden Cinema and The North China Lover. A film version of The Lover, produced by Claude Berri, was released to great success in 1992.<br /><br />Other major works include Moderato Cantabile, also made into a film of the same name, Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein, and her film India Song. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film Hiroshima mon amour, which was directed by Alain Resnais.<br /><br />Duras's early novels were fairly conventional in form (their 'romanticism' was criticised by fellow writer Raymond Queneau); however, with Moderato Cantabile she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the Nouveau roman French literary movement, although did not definitively belong to any group. Her films are also experimental in form, most eschewing synch sound, using voice over to allude to, rather than tell, a story over images whose relation to what is said may be more-or-less tangential.<br /><br />Marguerite's adult life was somewhat difficult, despite her success as a writer, and she was known for her periods of alcoholism. She died in Paris, aged 82 from throat cancer and is interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. Her tomb is marked simply 'MD'.<br /><br />From wikipedia",

        "biography": "Charles Willeford was a remarkably fine, talented and prolific writer who wrote everything from poetry to crime fiction to literary criticism throughout the course of his impressively long and diverse career. His crime novels are distinguished by a mean'n'lean sense of narrative economy and an admirable dearth of sentimentality. He was born as Charles Ray Willeford III on January 2, 1919 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Willeford's parents both died of tuberculosis when he was a little boy and he subsequently lived either with his grandmother or at boarding schools. Charles became a hobo in his early teens. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps at age sixteen and was stationed in the Philippines. Willeford served as a tank commander with the 10th Armored Division in Europe during World War II. He won several medals for his military service: the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and the Luxembourg Croix de Guerre. Charles retired from the army as a Master Sergeant. Willeford's first novel \"High Priest of California\" was published in 1953. This solid debut was followed by such equally excellent novels as \"Pick-Up\" (this book won a Beacon Fiction Award), \"Wild Wives,\" \"The Woman Chaser,\" \"Cockfighter\" (this particular book won the Mark Twain Award), and \"The Burnt Orange Heresy.\" Charles achieved his greatest commercial and critical success with four outstanding novels about hapless Florida homicide detective Hoke Moseley: \"Miami Blues,\" \"New Hope for the Dead,\" \"Sideswipe,\" and \"The Way We Die Now.\" Outside of his novels, he also wrote the short story anthology \"The Machine in Ward Eleven,\" the poetry collections \"The Outcast Poets\" and \"Proletarian Laughter,\" and the nonfiction book \"Something About A Soldier.\" Willeford attended both Palm Beach Junior College and the University of Miami. He taught a course in humanities at the University of Miami and was an associate professor who taught classes in both philosophy and English at Miami Dade Junior College. Charles was married three times and was an associate editor for \"Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine.\" Three of Willeford's novels have been adapted into movies: Monte Hellman delivered a bleakly fascinating character study with \"Cockfighter\" (Charles wrote the script and has a sizable supporting role as the referee of a cockfighting tournament which climaxes the picture), George Armitage hit one out of the ballpark with the wonderfully quirky \"Miami Blues,\" and Robinson Devor scored a bull's eye with the offbeat \"The Woman Chaser.\" Charles popped up in a small part as a bartender in the fun redneck car chase romp \"Thunder and Lightning.\" Charles Willeford died of a heart attack at age 69 on March 27, 1988.",

He is the earliest of the three Greek tragedians whose plays survive extant, the others being Sophocles and Euripides. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in plays to allow for conflict among them; previously, characters interacted only with the chorus. Unfortunately, only seven of an estimated 70 plays by Aeschylus have survived into modern times; one of these plays, <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, is sometimes thought not to be the work of Aeschylus.<br /><br />At least one of Aeschylus's works was influenced by the Persian invasion of Greece, which took place during his lifetime. His play <i>The Persians</i> remains a good primary source of information about this period in Greek history. The war was so important to Greeks and to Aeschylus himself that, upon his death around 456 BC, his epitaph included a reference to his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon but not to his success as a playwright.<br /><br />There are no reliable sources for the life of Aeschylus. He was said to have been born in c. 525 in Eleusis, a small town about 27 kilometers northwest of Athens, which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western Attica, though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was both wealthy and well-established; his father Euphorion was a member of the Eupatridae, the ancient nobility of Attica.<br /><br />As a youth, he worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer Pausanias, the god Dionysus visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy. As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began writing a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old. After fifteen years, his skill was great enough to win a prize for his plays at Athens' annual city Dionysia playwriting competition. But in the interim, his dramatic career was interrupted by war. The armies of the Persian Empire, which had already conquered the Greek city-states of Ionia, entered mainland Greece in the hopes of conquering it as well.<br /><br />In 490 BC, Aeschylus and his brother Cynegeirus fought to defend Athens against Darius's invading Persian army at the Battle of Marathon. Though Athens was victorious, Cynegeirus died in the battle. Aeschylus continued to write plays during the lull between the first and second Persian invasions of Greece, and won his first victory at the city Dionysia in 484 BC. In 480 he was called into military service again, this time against Xerxes' invading forces at the Battle of Salamis. This naval battle holds a prominent place in The Persians, his oldest surviving play, which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the Dionysia.<br /><br />Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult to Demeter based in his hometown of Eleusis. As the name implies, members of the cult were supposed to have gained some sort of mystical, secret knowledge. Firm details of the Mysteries' specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to Aristotle, it was alleged that Aeschylus had placed clues about the secret rites in his seventh tragedy, <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. According to some sources, an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. When he stood trial for his offense, Aeschylus pleaded ignorance and was only spared because of his brave service in the Persian Wars.<br /><br />Aeschylus traveled to Sicily once or twice in the 470s BC, having",

        "biography": "Sir William Gerald Golding was a British novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his 1954 novel <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies\" title=\"Lord of the Flies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lord of the Flies</a>. Golding spent two years in Oxford focusing on sciences; however, he changed his educational emphasis to English literature, especially Anglo-Saxon.<br /><br />During World War II, he was part of the Royal Navy which he left five years later. His bellic experience strongly influenced his future novels. Later, he became a teacher and focused on writing. Some of his influences are classical Greek literature, such as Euripides, and <i>The Battle of Maldon</i>, an Anglo-Saxon oeuvre whose author is unknown.<br /><br />The attention given to <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, Golding's first novel, by college students in the 1950s and 1960s drove literary critics' attention to it. He was awarded the Booker Prize for literature in 1980 for his novel <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14431.Rites_of_Passage\" title=\"Rites of Passage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rites of Passage</a>, the first book of the trilogy <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/58734-to-the-ends-of-the-earth\" rel=\"nofollow\">To the Ends of the Earth</a>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983 and was knighted in 1988.<br /><br />In 2008, <i>The Times</i> ranked Golding third on their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".",

        "biography": "Nikola Tesla was a genius polymath, inventor and a mechanical and electrical engineer. He is frequently cited as one of the most important contributors to the birth of commercial electricity, a man who \"shed light over the face of Earth,\" and is best known for his many revolutionary developments in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tesla's patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current (AC) electric power systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />Born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, Vojna Krajina, in the territory of today's Croatia, he was a subject of the Austrian Empire by birth and later became an American citizen. After his demonstration of wireless communication (radio) in 1894 and after being the victor in the \"War of Currents\", he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in America. Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. During this period, in the United States, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist in history or popular culture, but due to his eccentric personality and his seemingly unbelievable and sometimes bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological developments, Tesla was ultimately ostracized and regarded as a mad scientist. Never having put much focus on his finances, Tesla died impoverished at the age of 86.<br /><br />The SI unit measuring magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic field \"B\"), the tesla, was named in his honor (at the <i>Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures</i>, Paris, 1960), as well as the Tesla effect of wireless energy transfer to wirelessly power electronic devices which Tesla demonstrated on a low scale (lightbulbs) as early as 1893 and aspired to use for the intercontinental transmission of industrial energy levels in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.<br /><br />Aside from his work on electromagnetism and electromechanical engineering, Tesla contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of robotics, remote control, radar and computer science, and to the expansion of ballistics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States credited him as being the inventor of the radio. Many of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and early New Age occultism.<br />",

        "biography": "Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BCE \u2013 CE 17/18), known as Ovid (/\u02c8\u0252v\u026ad/) in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet best known for the Metamorphoses, a 15-book continuous mythological narrative written in the meter of epic, and for collections of love poetry in elegiac couplets, especially the Amores (\"Love Affairs\") and Ars Amatoria (\"Art of Love\"). His poetry was much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and greatly influenced Western art and literature. The Metamorphoses remains one of the most important sources of classical mythology.<br /><br />Ovid is traditionally ranked alongside Virgil and Horace, his older contemporaries, as one of the three canonic poets of Latin literature. He was the first major Roman poet to begin his career during the reign of Augustus, and the Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but in one of the mysteries of literary history he was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to carmen et error, \"a poem and a mistake\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.<br /><br />Ovid's prolific poetry includes the Heroides, a collection of verse epistles written as by mythological heroines to the lovers who abandoned them; the Fasti, an incomplete six-book exploration of Roman religion with a calendar structure; and the Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto, two collections of elegies in the form of complaining letters from his exile. His shorter works include the Remedia Amoris (\"Cure for Love\"), the curse-poem Ibis, and an advice poem on women's cosmetics. He wrote a lost tragedy, Medea, and mentions that some of his other works were adapted for staged performance.<br /><br />See also <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16509863.Ovide\" title=\"Ovide\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ovide</a>.",

He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recover their own heart in his love, and learn to live in his Kingdom. John grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles (which he hated), and spent his boyhood summers on his grandfather\u2019s cattle ranch in eastern Oregon (which he loved). John met his wife Stasi in high school (in drama class). But their romance did not begin until they each came to faith in Christ, after high school. John earned his undergraduate degree in Theater at Cal Poly, and directed a theater company in Los Angeles for several years before moving to Colorado with Focus on the Family, where he taught at the Focus on the Family Institute.<br /><br />John earned his master\u2019s degree in Counseling from Colorado Christian University, under the direction of Larry Crabb and Dan Allender. He worked as a counselor in private practice before launching Ransomed Heart in 2000. John and Stasi live in Colorado Springs with their three sons (Samuel, Blaine and Luke), their golden retriever (Oban), and two horses (Whistle and Kokolo). While all of this is factually true, it somehow misses describing an actual person. He loves the outdoors passionately, and all beauty, Shakespeare, bow hunting, a good cigar, anything having to do with adventure, poetry, March Madness, working in the shop, fly fishing, classic rock, the Tetons, fish tacos, George MacDonald, green tea, buffalo steaks, dark chocolate, wild and open places, horses running, and too much more to name. He also uses the expression \u201cfar out\u201d way too much. <br />",

        "biography": "Barbara Mary Willard was born in Brighton, Sussex in 1909, and was educated at a convent school in Southampton. Her father was a Shakespearean actor; she absorbed Shakespeare from childhood and language was always important to her. Before the war she worked briefly as an actress and a playreader, before starting to write fiction. Barbara Willard wrote many adult novels before venturing into children's fiction; late in her writing career came the historical series known as the Mantlemass novels, and it is for these that she is now chiefly remembered. In 1967 she published A Grove of Green Holly (not one of the series) about a group of 17th century travelling players, hiding from Cromwell's soldiers in Ashdown Forest in Sussex, encountering iron workers and forest ways. From this root came the idea of writing about the same place and its development and change through earlier periods of history; a concept which was to evolve into the Mantlemass books. This series has received much critical acclaim and has ensured Barbara Willard a place in the mainstream of children's historical fiction, along with writers such as Geoffrey Trease, Rosemary Sutcliff and Cynthia Harnett. Two early volumes were runners up for the Guardian award for children's fiction, which she won with The Iron Lily in 1974. <br /><br />(courtesy Belinda Copson)",

Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, \"No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry.\" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (n\u00e9e Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: \"I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee.\" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said \"taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,\" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, \"I wasn\u2019t particularly happy. I think it\u2019s a dreadful time of life.\" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, \"Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of.\" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.\" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.",

        "biography": "Henry Miller sought to reestablish the freedom to live without the conventional restraints of civilization. His books are potpourris of sexual description, quasi-philosophical speculation, reflection on literature and society, surrealistic imaginings, and autobiographical incident. <br /><br />After living in Paris in the 1930s, he returned to the United States and settled in Big Sur, California. Miller's first two works, <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> (Paris, 1934) and <i>Tropic of Capricorn</i> (Paris, 1939), were denied publication in the U.S. until the early 1960s because of alleged obscenity. <i>The Colossus of Maroussi</i> (1941), a travel book of modern Greece, is considered by some critics his best work. His other writings include the <i>Rosy Crucifixion Trilogy</i> \u2014 <i>Sexus</i> (1949), <i>Plexus</i> (1953), and <i>Nexus</i> (1960). In 1976 Norman Mailer edited a selection of Miller's writings, <i>Genius and Lust</i>. <br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Miller\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mi...</a>",

The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams. He was known to some fans as Bop Ad (after his illegible signature), or by his initials \"DNA\".<br /><br />In addition to <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the Dirk Gently novels, and he co-wrote two Liff books and <i>Last Chance to See</i>, itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game <i>Starship Titanic</i>, which was produced by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by Terry Jones.

        "biography": "Riki Wilchins is an activist whose work has focused on the impact of gender norms. While she started out as a transgender leader -- founding the first national transgender advocacy group (GenderPAC) -- her analysis and work broadened over time to include discrimination and violence regardless of individuals' identity. While this perspective has been widely accepted, its breadth has provoked criticism by some in the transgender community. Wilchins' work and writing has often focused on youth, whom she not only sees as uniquely vulnerable to the gender system's pressures and harm, but whom she sees as capable of \"looking with fresh eyes.\" Wilchins' work has been instrumental in bringing transgender rights into the mainstream LGBT movmement, and has helped bring awareness of the impact of gender norms to a wider audience. In 2001, Wilchins' work resulted in her being selected one of just six community activists named by TIME Magazine among its \"100 Civic Innovators for the 21st Century.\" <br /><br />A founding member of Camp Trans, since the mid-1990s Wilchins has been highly active in founding a number of organizations and events focused on gender issues, including:<br /><br />The Transexual Menace, the first large direct action group for transgender rights, which was modeled along the lines of Queer Nation and which at one point boasted representatives in 40+ cities (co-founder Denise Norris).<br />Hermaphrodites With Attitude, the first direct action group for the intersex (co-founder Cheryl Chase, Executive Director of the ISNA, the Intersex Society of North America).<br />NYC Gay Community Center Gender Identity Project (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).<br />NYC Gay Community Center Transgender Health Empowerment Conference, an annual event (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).<br />Camp Trans, an annual educational event outside the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival that contests the exclusion of anyone who is not deemed a \"womyn-born womyn\" (co-founders Janice Walworth, Nancy Jean Burkholder).<br />National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (co-founder Susan Wright, its first Exec. Dir.)<br />National Gender Lobby Day, an annual event on Capitol Hill (co-founder Phyllis Frye).<br /><br />In 1995 Wilchins founded the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition GenderPAC, a tax-exempt organization focused on gender rights issues. GenderPAC originally focused on the transgender community, but gradually broadened its focus to include anyone who suffered discrimination or violence because of their gender identity or gender expression. GenderPAC described its mission as the creation of \"classrooms, communities, and workplaces [that] are safe for everyone to learn, grow, and succeed - whether or not they meet expectations for masculinity and femininity.\" <br /><br />In late 1999, the organization was incorporated and received tax-exempt status. In 2009 it rebranded and relaunched as a new organization, effectively ceasing operations as GenderPAC. While GenderPAC's Executive Director, Wilchins helped dozens of corporations as diverse as IBM, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, as well as major funders like the Arcus and Gill Foundations to expand their employment non-discrimination policies to include gender identity and gender expression. GenderPAC's Congressional Non-Discrimination Pledge eventually had almost 200 sponsors, including both Republicans and US Senators. She helped compile and publish the GENIUS (Gender Equality National Index for Universities &amp; Schools) Index, which rated and ranked schools' adoption of gender identity protections. During her watch, GenderPAC also launched the GenderYOUTH Network, which eventually supported student groups at 100+ schools in creating safer and friendlier environments for those who were gender non-conforming on their own campuses.<br /><br />With help from researcher Emilia Lombardi, GenderPAC compiled and published the \"1st National Survey of TransViolence,\" based on surveys provided by more than 500.",

E-mails come in by hundreds. GATES OF FIRE is on the Commandant of the Marine Corps' Reading list. It is taught at West Point and Annapolis and at the Marine Corps Basic School at Quantico. TIDES OF WAR is on the curriculum of the Naval War College.<br /><br />From 2nd Battalion/6th Marines, which calls itself \"the Spartans,\" to ODA 316 of the Special Forces, whose forearms are tattooed with the lambda of Lakedaemon, today's young warriors find a bond to their ancient precursors in the historical narratives of these novels. <br /><br />My struggles to earn a living as a writer (it took seventeen years to get the first paycheck) are detailed in my 2002 book, THE WAR OF ART. <br /><br />I have worked as an advertising copywriter, schoolteacher, tractor-trailer driver, bartender, oilfield roustabout and attendant in a mental hospital. I have picked fruit in Washington state and written screenplays in Tinseltown. <br /><br />With the publication of THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE in 1995, I became a writer of books once and for all. <br /><br />My writing philosophy is, not surprisingly, a kind of warrior code \u2014 internal rather than external \u2014 in which the enemy is identified as those forms of self-sabotage that I have labeled \"Resistance\" with a capital R (in THE WAR OF ART) and the technique for combatting these foes can be described as \"turning pro.\" <br /><br />I believe in previous lives. <br /><br />I believe in the Muse. <br /><br />I believe that books and music exist before they are written and that they are propelled into material being by their own imperative to be born, via the offices of those willing servants of discipline, imagination and inspiration, whom we call artists. My conception of the artist's role is a combination of reverence for the unknowable nature of \"where it all comes from\" and a no-nonsense, blue-collar demystification of the process by which this mystery is approached. In other words, a paradox. <br /><br />There's a recurring character in my books named Telamon, a mercenary of ancient days. Telamon doesn't say much. He rarely gets hurt or wounded. And he never seems to age. His view of the profession of arms is a lot like my conception of art and the artist: <br /><br />\"It is one thing to study war, and another to live the warrior's life.\"<br /><br />",

Her first novel, Restoree, was written as a protest against the absurd and unrealistic portrayals of women in s-f novels in the 50s and early 60s. It is, however, in the handling of broader themes and the worlds of her imagination, particularly the two series The Ship Who Sang and the fourteen novels about the Dragonriders of Pern that Ms. McCaffrey\u2019s talents as a story-teller are best displayed.<br /><br />She died at the age of 85, after suffering a massive stroke on 21 November 2011.<br /><br />Obituaries: <a href=\"http://www.locusmag.com/News/2011/11/anne-mccaffrey-1926-2011/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Locus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/anne-mccaffrey-has-died_b42826\" rel=\"nofollow\">GalleyCat</a>.",

Their books have appeared on both the New York Times and USA Today best seller lists. The series has garnered 11 major crime-fiction awards, and an Edgar\u00ae nomination. Parrish has won two Shamus awards, one Anthony and one International Thriller competition. Her books have been published throughout Europe and Asia.<br /><br />Parrish's short stories have also appeared in many anthologies, including two published by Mystery Writers of America, edited by Harlan Coben and the late Stuart Kaminsky. Their stories have also appeared in Akashic Books acclaimed Detroit Noir, and in Ellery Queen Magazine. Most recently, they contributed an essay to a special edition of Edgar Allan Poe's works edited by Michael Connelly.<br /><br />P.J. Parrish as children<br />Before turning to writing full time, Kristy Montee was a newspaper editor and dance critic for the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale. Nichols previously was a blackjack dealer and then a human resources specialist in the casino industry. Kris in Tallahassee FL and Traverse City MI and Kelly resides in Traverse City as well.<br /><br />The sisters were writers as kids, albeit with different styles: Kelly's first attempt at fiction at age 11 was titled The Kill. Kristy's at 13 was The Cat Who Understood. Not much has changed: Kelly now tends to handle the gory stuff and Kristy the character development. But the collaboration is a smooth one, thanks to lots of ego suppression, good wine, and marathon phone calls via Skype.<br /><br />The first eleven books in the series, in order, are: Dark of the Moon, Dead of Winter, Paint it Black, Thicker than Water, Island of Bones, A Killing Rain, An Unquiet Grave, A Thousand Bones, South of Hell, The Little Death and Heart of Ice. They also wrote three stand-alone thrillers: A Thousand Bones, The Killing Song and She's Not There.",

        "biography": "Alisa Rosenbaum was born in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg to a prosperous Jewish family. When the Bolsheviks requisitioned the pharmacy owned by her father, Fronz, the Rosenbaums fled to the Crimea. Alisa returned to the city (renamed Leningrad) to attend the university, but in 1926 relatives who had already settled in America offered her the chance of joining them there. With money from the sale of her mother's jewelry, Alisa bought a ticket to New York. On arrival at Ellis Island, she changed into Ayn (after a name of some Finnish author, probably \"Aino\") Rand (which she said was an abbreviation of her Russian surname). She moved swiftly to Hollywood, where she learned English, worked in the RKO wardrobe department and as an extra, and wrote through the night on screenplays and novels. She also married a bit-part actor called Frank O'Connor because he was 'beautiful' - and because her original visitor's visa had run out.<br />Rand sold her first screenplay in 1932, but nobody would buy her first novel <i>We the Living</i> (1936) a melodrama set in Russia. Her first real success was <i>The Fountainhead</i> (rejected by more than ten publishers before publication in 1943).<br />She started a new philosophy known as Objectivism, opposed to state interference of all kinds, and her follow-up novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) describes a group who attempt to escape America's conspiracy of mediocrity. Objectivism has been an influence on various other movements such as Libertarianism, and Rand's vocal support for Laissez-faire Capitalism and the free market has earned her a distinct spot among American philosophers, and philosophers in general.<br /><br />---<br />",

Goffman's other areas of study included social order and interaction, impression management, total institutions, social organization of experience, and stigmas. Some of the influences on his works include Durkheim, Freud, Mead, Radcliffe-Brown, and Simmel.<br /><br />In 2007 Goffman was listed as the 6th most-cited intellectual in the humanities and social sciences by The Times Higher Education Guide, behind Anthony Giddens and ahead of J\u00fcrgen Habermas.[1]. Goffman was also named the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association. Goffman is more cited today from his books than during his time. Writers today use his ideas to examine the relationship between individual behavior and the reproduction of social systems.<br />",

He is the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy at Yeshiva University, director of the Yeshiva Center for History and Philosophy of Science, and a professor at Johns Hopkins University.<br /><br />Achinstein received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard with a dissertation on Carnap's theory of probability. It was the German philosopher Carl G. Hempel, in a visit to Harvard in 1953\u20134 (replacing W.V. Quine who was on leave), that motivated him to pursue Philosophy of Science. Upon getting a Harvard Traveling Fellowship, Achinstein spent a year in Oxford in 1959 working under the guidance of P. F. Strawson. In Oxford he attended seminars and lectures delivered by Gilbert Ryle, A.J. Ayer, and J.L. Austin. Achinstein specializes in philosophy of science with strong interests in the history of science.<br /><br />Achinstein has taught for many years at Johns Hopkins University, where he is currently Professor of Philosophy. In Spring 2009, Achinstein began teaching at Yeshiva University as the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy and is the founder and director of the Center for History and Philosophy of Science of Yeshiva University, New York. He returned to Johns Hopkins in Spring 2011. He has held Guggenheim, NEH, and NSF fellowships, and has served as a visiting professor at MIT, Stanford, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br /><br />He is the author of five influential books in the history and philosophy of science. Among them are <i>Particles and Waves</i>, which received the prestigious Lakatos Award in 1993. This book is a study of methodological problems arising from three episodes in 19th century physics: the wave-particle debate about light, the development of the kinetic-molecular theory, and the discovery of the electron. In 2001, Achinstein published <i>The Book of Evidence</i>, a philosophical and historical study of various concepts of evidence employed in the sciences. A volume of his important collected essays over the years, <i>Evidence, Explanation, and Realism</i>, was published in the spring of 2010. A special volume honoring him, <i>Philosophy of Science Matters: The Philosophy of Peter Achinstein</i>, was published in 2011. In 2013, Achinstein published <i>Evidence and Method: Scientific Strategies of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell</i>.<br /><br /><i>Wikipedia</i>",

He was educated at Uppingham School and Merton College, Oxford, where he studied English.<br /><br />In 2003, Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and in 2004, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best First Book for his novel <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</i>, a book which is written from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers syndrome. Haddon's knowledge of Aspergers syndrome, a type of autism, comes from his work with autistic people as a young man. In an interview at Powells.com, Haddon claimed that this was the first book that he wrote intentionally for an adult audience; he was surprised when his publisher suggested marketing it to both adult and child audiences. His second adult-novel, <i>A Spot of Bother</i>, was published in September 2006.<br /><br />Mark Haddon is also known for his series of Agent Z books, one of which, <i>Agent Z and the Penguin from Mars</i>, was made into a 1996 Children's BBC sitcom. He also wrote the screenplay for the BBC television adaptation of Raymond Briggs's story Fungus the Bogeyman, screened on BBC1 in 2004. He also wrote the 2007 BBC television drama Coming Down the Mountain.<br /><br />Haddon is a vegetarian, and enjoys vegetarian cookery. He describes himself as a 'hard-line atheist'. In an interview with The Observer, Haddon said \"I am atheist in a very religious mould\". His atheism might be inferred from <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</i> in which the main character declares that those who believe in God are stupid.<br /><br />Mark Haddon lives in Oxford with his wife Dr. Sos Eltis, a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, and their two young sons.",

        "biography": "Simon Schama was born in 1945. The son of a textile merchant with Lithuanian and Turkish grandparents, he spent his early years in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. When his parents moved to London he won a scholarship to Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s School where his two great loves were English and History. Forced to choose between the two he opted to read history at Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge. Here he was taught by Sir John Plumb whose other students: Linda Colley, Roy Porter and John Brewer are now central to British historical thought. It was Plumb\u2019s influence which instilled in him the importance of narrative and written style in order to gain an audience for history outside academia. One of the hallmarks of Schama\u2019s work is his flair for description: \u2018he gets arcane matters to walk, in fact dance, off the page\u2019 according to fellow historian Peter Hennessy. However, his approach is contentious and invites criticism of subjectivity and populism from academic circles. Schama remained at Christ\u2019s for 10 years after his degree, becoming a fellow and then director of Studies, before moving to Brasenose College Oxford. While at Oxford he wrote <i>Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands 1780-1813</i> (1977), which won the Wolfson Literary Award, and <i>Two Rothschilds and the Land of Israel</i> (1979). At Oxford he met his wife, Ginny Papaioannou a geneticist from California.<br /><br />Tired of the Oxford system (he once described his experience as being \u2018like a gerbil on a treadmill\u2019) and enticed by the freedom of US Academic life, he moved to America in 1980, becoming Professor of History at Harvard. Here he wrote <i>The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age</i> (1987), <i>Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution</i> (1989) and <i>Dead Certainties (Unwarranted Speculations)</i> (1991): an a unusual linking of the death of General Wolfe at Quebec in 1759 and the murder of a doctor, George Parkman, by a Harvard Professor in 1849. <i>Citizens</i>, which was written at lightening speed: 900 pages in only 18 months, won the 1990 NCR Book Award. However, Schama\u2019s emphasis on the terror and violence of the revolution and his argument, that from its beginning it was a \u2018<i>sacrament of blood</i>\u2019, ensured it has never found a publisher in France. He is now professor in history and art history at Columbia where he has written <i>Landscape and Memory</i> (1996) which received the W H Smith Literary Award and Rembrandt\u2019s Eyes (1999). The latter is a controversial reassessment of the artist which attempts to reinstate the notion of Rembrandt the genius, aiming to invoke the atmosphere as well as the historical context. In Schama\u2019s view, as he tells David D\u2019Arcy in Art Newspaper \u2018<i>There are some passages of sublime reinvention for which history has absolutely no answers\u2026it seems to me pointless and trivial to pretend that it does.</i>\u2019<br /><br />Simon Schama has also worked for the BBC on a 16 part series: \u2018<i>A History of Britain</i>\u2019 and has been an art critic and cultural essayist for <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>Talk</i> magazine. He lives in New York with his wife and their two children Chloe and Gabriel.",

Parker</a>.</i><br /><b>Robert Brown Parker</b> was an American crime writer. His most famous works were the novels about the private detective Spenser. ABC television network developed the television series <i>Spenser: For Hire</i> based on the character in the late 1980s; a series of TV movies based on the character were also produced. His works incorporate encyclopedic knowledge of the Boston metropolitan area. Parker was 77 when he died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts; discovered at his desk by his wife Joan, he had been working on a novel. The Spenser novels have been cited by critics and bestselling authors such as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8944.Robert_Crais\" title=\"Robert Crais\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Crais</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/24689.Harlan_Coben\" title=\"Harlan Coben\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harlan Coben</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10289.Dennis_Lehane\" title=\"Dennis Lehane\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dennis Lehane</a> as not only influencing their own work but reviving and changing the detective genre.<br />Robert B. Parker was one of contemporary fiction's most popular and respected detective writers. Best known for his portrayal of the tough but erudite investigator Spenser, Parker wrote over twenty-five novels over the course of his career, which began in 1973. Parker's acclaim and his thorough background in classic detective literature helped earn him the somewhat unusual commission of completing a Philip Marlowe novel that the great Raymond Chandler had left unfinished. <br /><br />Promised Land and the other Spenser novels spawned the movie Spenser: For Hire and a string of made-for-TV movies.",

        "biography": "John R. Erickson, a former cowboy and ranch manager, is gifted with a storyteller's knack for spinning a yarn. Through the eyes of Hank the Cowdog, a smelly, smart-aleck Head of Ranch Security, Erickson gives readers a glimpse of daily life on a ranch in the West Texas Panhandle. This series of books and tapes is in school libraries across the country, has sold more than 7.6 million copies, is a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and is the winner of the 1993 Audie for Outstanding Children's Series from the Audio Publisher's Association. Publishers Weekly calls Hank a \"grassroots publishing phenomena,\" and USA Today says this is \"the best family entertainment in years.\"<br /><br />Hank the Cowdog made his debut in the pages of The Cattleman, a magazine for adults, and when Erickson started getting \"Dear Hank\" letters, he knew he was onto something. So in 1983, he self-published 2,000 copies of The Original Adventures of Hank the Cowdog, and they sold out in 6 weeks. <br /><br />When teachers began inviting Erickson to their schools, Hank found his most eager fans. Teachers, librarians, and students alike love Hank. According to some Texas Library Association surveys, the Hank the Cowdog books are the most popular selections in many libraries' children's sections. The lively characters make excellent material for reading and writing lessons, and turn even the most reluctant readers into avid Hank-fans. <br /><br />Erickson was born in Midland, Texas, but by the age of 3, he had moved with his family to Perryton, Texas, where he and his wife live today on their working cattle ranch. They have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren. His advice to young writers is, \"Write about something you know. Try to leave your readers better off than they were before.\"<br />",

In March 1998, while reading the apostolic fathers and subsequent church history in preparation for a Wednesday evening bible study, Alex Jones discovered the Catholic Church to be charismatic/liturgical, hierarchical, and Eucharistic-centered. In light of that revelation, Alex and his wife Donna began a two year journey into the Catholic Church that culminated in fifty-four members of his previous congregation, including fourteen members of his own family, entering the Catholic Church. The group began R.C.I.A. at St. Suzanne Catholic Community on September 10, 2000 and were welcomed into the Catholic Church through confirmation during Easter Vigil on April 14, 2001. Alex Jones was subsequently ordained a Permanent Deacon in the Archdiocese of Detroit on October 1, 2005. Deacon Jones received his Masters in Pastoral Studies from Sacred Heart Major Seminary on April 28, 2007 and retired from the position of evangelization coordinator for the Archdiocese of Detroit on May 31, 2007. Deacon Jones currently serves the three parishes of St. Suzanne/OLGH, St. Mary of Redford, and St. Thomas Aquinas. He and his wife Donna have three sons and ten grandchildren.",

Ancient scholars thought that Euripides had written ninety-five plays, although four of those were probably written by Critias. Eighteen of Euripides' plays have survived complete. It is now widely believed that what was thought to be a nineteenth, Rhesus, was probably not by Euripides. Fragments, some substantial, of most of the other plays also survive. More of his plays have survived than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly because of the chance preservation of a manuscript that was probably part of a complete collection of his works in alphabetical order.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides</a>",

She has to date published more than thirty novels and several comprehensive writing courses. She has just published WARPAINT, the second stand-alone novel in her Cadence Drake series.<br /><br />Holly had an ideal childhood for a writer\u2026which is to say, it was filled with foreign countries and exotic terrains, alien cultures, new languages, the occasional earthquake, flood, or civil war, and one story about a bear, which follows:<br /><br />\u201cSo. Back when I was ten years old, my father and I had finished hunting ducks for our dinner and were walking across the tundra in Alaska toward the spot on the river where we\u2019d tied our boat. We had a couple miles to go by boat to get back to the Moravian Children\u2019s Home, where we lived.<br /><br />\u201cMy father was carrying the big bag of decoys and the shotgun; I was carrying the small bag of ducks.<br /><br />\u201cIt was getting dark, we could hear the thud, thud, thud of the generator across the tundra, and suddenly he stopped, pointed down to a pie-pan sized indentation in the tundra that was rapidly filling with water, and said, in a calm and steady voice, \u201cThat\u2019s a bear footprint. From the size of it, it\u2019s a grizzly. The fact that the track is filling with water right now means the bear\u2019s still around.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhich got my attention, but not as much as what he said next.<br /><br />\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t have the gun with me that will kill a bear,\u2019 he told me. \u2018I just have the one that will make him angry. So if we see the bear, I\u2019m going to shoot him so he\u2019ll attack me. I want you to run to the river, follow it to the boat, get the boat back home, and tell everyone what happened.\u2019<br /><br />\u201cThe rest of our walk was very quiet. He was, I\u2019m sure, listening for the bear. I was doing my damnedest to make sure that I remembered where the boat was, how to get to it, how to start the pull-cord engine, and how to drive it back home, because I did not want to let him down.<br /><br />\u201cWe were not eaten by a bear that night\u2026but neither is that walk back from our hunt for supper a part of my life I\u2019ll ever forget.<br /><br />\u201cI keep that story in mind as I write. If what I\u2019m putting on paper isn\u2019t at least as memorable as having a grizzly stalking my father and me across the tundra while I was carrying a bag of delicious-smelling ducks, it doesn\u2019t make my cut.\u201d<br /><br />You can find Holly on her personal site:<br /><a href=\"http://hollylisle.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hollylisle.com</a><br /><br />You can find Cadence Drake, Holly's currently in-progress series, on <i>her</i> site:<br /><a href=\"http://cadencedrake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">CadenceDrake.com</a><br /><br />You can find Holly's books, courses, writing workshops, and so on here:<br /><a href=\"http://howtothinksideways.com/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The HowToThinkSideways.com Shop</a>, as well as on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and in a number of bookstores in the US and around the world.",

        "biography": "Mary Ann Evans, known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She was born in 1819 at a farmstead in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, where her father was estate manager. Mary Ann, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good education for a young woman of her day. Influenced by a favorite governess, she became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. <br /><br />Her first published work was a religious poem. Through a family friend, she was exposed to Charles Hennell's \"An Inquiry into the Origins of Christianity\". Unable to believe, she conscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. Her father shunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister until she promised to reexamine her feelings. Her intellectual views did not, however, change. She translated \"Das Leben Jesu\", a monumental task, without signing her name to the 1846 work. <br /><br />After her father's death in 1849, Mary Ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with The Westminster Review. Despite a heavy workload, she translated \"The Essence of Christianity\", the only book ever published under her real name. That year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized British society by sending notices to friends announcing she had entered a free \"union\" with George Henry Lewes, editor of The Leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. They lived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social ostracism and financial hardship. She became salaried and began writing essays and reviews for The Westminster Review. <br /><br />Renaming herself \"Marian\" in private life and adopting the penname \"George Eliot,\" she began her impressive fiction career, including: \"Adam Bede\" (1859), \"The Mill on the Floss\" (1860), \"Silas Marner\" (1861), \"Romola\" (1863), and \"Middlemarch\" (1871). Themes included her humanist vision and strong heroines. Her poem, \"O May I Join the Choir Invisible\" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: \"O may I join the choir invisible/ Of those immortal dead who live again/ In minds made better by their presence. . .\" D. 1880.<br /><br />Her 1872 work Middlemarch has been described by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.<br /><br />More: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/eliot_george.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184688/George-Eliot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/t...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/authors/eliot/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/george-eliot-9286017\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biography.com/people/georg...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/deronda/ei_eliot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/d...</a>",

        "biography": "John Steinbeck III was an American writer. He wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and the novella Of Mice and Men, published in 1937. In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. <br /><br />In 1962 Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck grew up in the Salinas Valley region of California, a culturally diverse place of rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place. <br /><br />Steinbeck moved briefly to New York City, but soon returned home to California to begin his career as a writer. Most of his earlier work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel Cup of Gold which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.<br /><br />In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. Later he used real historical conditions and events in the first half of 20th century America, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. <br /><br />Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. His later body of work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history, and mythology. <br /><br />One of his last published works was Travels with Charley, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America. He died in 1968 in New York of a heart attack and his ashes are interred in Salinas.<br /><br />Seventeen of his works, including The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Cannery Row (1945), The Pearl (1947), and East of Eden (1952), went on to become Hollywood films, and Steinbeck also achieved success as a Hollywood writer, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Story in 1944 for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat.",

        "biography": "<i>There is more than one author by this name on Goodreads.</i><br /><br />Best-selling author and public speaker, Robert Greene was born in Los Angeles. He attended U.C. California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he received a degree in classical studies. He has worked in New York as an editor and writer at several magazines, including Esquire; and in Hollywood as a story developer and writer. <br /><br />Robert has lived in London, Paris, and Barcelona; he speaks several languages and has worked as a translator. In 1995 he was involved in the planning and creation of the art school Fabrica, outside Venice, Italy. There he met Joost Elffers, the New York book packager and discussed with him his idea for a book on power and manipulation, the ultimate modern version of Machiavelli's The Prince.<br /><br />Robert and Joost became partners and in 1998, The 48 Laws of Power was born. The book has been a national and international bestseller, and has been translated into 17 languages. In 2001, Robert released his second book, The Art of Seduction, which is more than a sequel to The 48 Laws; it is both a handbook on how to wield the ultimate form of power, and a detailed look at the greatest seducers in history.<br /><br />The third in this highly anticipated series of books, The 33 Strategies of War, hit bookstores January 2006 and offers a strategic look behind the movements of War in application to everyday life. In addition to having a strong following within the business world and a deep following in Washington, DC, these books are also being hailed by everyone from war historians to some of the heaviest hitters in the rap world (including Jay-Z and 50 Cent).<br /><br />The popularity of these books along with their vast and fiercely loyal audience proves these are profound, timeless lessons from historical leaders that still ring true in today's culture. Robert currently lives in Los Angeles.",

        "biography": "Edith Newbold Jones was born into such wealth and privilege that her family inspired the phrase \"keeping up with the Joneses.\" The youngest of three children, Edith spent her early years touring Europe with her parents and, upon the family's return to the United States, enjoyed a privileged childhood in New York and Newport, Rhode Island. Edith's creativity and talent soon became obvious: By the age of eighteen she had written a novella, (as well as witty reviews of it) and published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly.<br /><br />After a failed engagement, Edith married a wealthy sportsman, Edward Wharton. Despite similar backgrounds and a shared taste for travel, the marriage was not a success. Many of Wharton's novels chronicle unhappy marriages, in which the demands of love and vocation often conflict with the expectations of society. Wharton's first major novel, <i>The House of Mirth,</i> published in 1905, enjoyed considerable literary success. <i>Ethan Frome</i> appeared six years later, solidifying Wharton's reputation as an important novelist. Often in the company of her close friend, Henry James, Wharton mingled with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and Jack London.<br /><br />In 1913 Edith divorced Edward. She lived mostly in France for the remainder of her life. When World War I broke out, she organized hostels for refugees, worked as a fund-raiser, and wrote for American publications from battlefield frontlines. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her courage and distinguished work.<br /><br /><i>The Age of Innocence,</i> a novel about New York in the 1870s, earned Wharton the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1921 -- the first time the award had been bestowed upon a woman. Wharton traveled throughout Europe to encourage young authors. She also continued to write, lying in her bed every morning, as she had always done, dropping each newly penned page on the floor to be collected and arranged when she was finished. Wharton suffered a stroke and died on August 11, 1937. She is buried in the American Cemetery in Versailles, France. <br /><i>- Barnesandnoble.com</i>",

He was a Latin philosopher and theologian from the Africa Province of the Roman Empire and is generally considered as one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all times. His writings were very influential in the development of Western Christianity. According to his contemporary Jerome, Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith.\" In his early years he was heavily influenced by Manichaeism and afterward by the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus. After his conversion to Christianity and his baptism in 387, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives. He believed that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, and he framed the concepts of original sin and just war. When the Western Roman Empire was starting to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the Catholic Church as a spiritual City of God (in a book of the same name), distinct from the material Earthly City. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Augustine's City of God was closely identified with the Church, the community that worshiped the Trinity. In the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, he is a saint and pre-eminent Doctor of the Church. Many Protestants, especially Calvinists, consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the Protestant Reformation due to his teaching on salvation and divine grace. In the Eastern Orthodox Church he is also considered a saint. He carries the additional title of Blessed. Among the Orthodox, he is called \"Blessed Augustine\" or \"St. Augustine the Blessed\".<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com:443/search/search?q=Santo Agostinho\" title=\"Santo Agostinho\">Santo Agostinho</a>",

With Nancy, she also wrote some highly regarded cookbooks focusing on healthy eating. She sometimes hires trained chefs to test the recipes that she creates, and makes sure that every recipe is tested at least three times before it appears in one of her cookbooks.<br /><br />Ruth's first fiction book was a collaborative effort with three friends Eileen Buckholtz, Louise Titchener, and Carolyn Males. The result was a romance novel Love is Elected, published in 1982 by Silhouette under the pseudonym Alyssa Howard. Her first novel was Invasion of the Blue Lights, a children's novel published in 1983. In the 1980s, she wrote under her married name young adult's fiction with Eileen Buckholtz, with whom she also wrote romance novels under the pseudonyms: Amanda Lee, Samantha Chase and Rebecca York. With Louise Titchener, she wrote under the pseudonym: Alexis Hill, Alexis Hill Jordan, and Tess Marlowe. In the late 1990s, her friend Eileen Buckholtz decided to stop writing under the pseudonym Rebecca York, and Ruth continued alone. She has continued to write novels of suspense and now also paranormal romantic suspense novels.<br /><br />Ruth lives with her husband in Columbia, Maryland, their children have grown, and they are grandparents of two boys, Jesse and Leo. She collects rocks, and enjoys cooking, walking, reading, gardening, travel, and Mozart operas.",
