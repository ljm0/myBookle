Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, \"No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry.\" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (n\u00e9e Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: \"I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee.\" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said \"taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,\" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, \"I wasn\u2019t particularly happy. I think it\u2019s a dreadful time of life.\" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, \"Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of.\" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.\" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.",

Continually experimenting with media, Mary underwent many artistic changes in her expressive visual form. Her concerns for light, color, drawing, and design came together in evocative, ethereal pastel paintings evolving toward a style she now calls \"soft geometry\". <br />Mary's new work attracted corporate advertising and editorial clients. Some of the include: Ogilvy &amp; Mather, BBD&amp;O, Whittle Communications, The Richards Group, Neenah Paper, Atlantic Monthly Magazine, Random House, Berkley, Penguin, Dell and McGraw Hill publishers. Recently, she was featured on the cover of Time Magazine for her work with the Harry Potter Series and also worked as a visionary in the environment/scenery development in Dreamworks animated film Antz<br /><br />Mary's work has received national recognition through awards received from: The Society of Illustrators, Communication Arts, Graphis, Print and Art Direction. Her work was chosen among thousands of illustrators to be on the cover of Showcase 16, and a n article was written about her \"conceptual editorial assignments\" in Step-by-Step Graphics. Communications Arts Magazine has also done a \"career retrospective\" article in their January/Febuary 200 edition.<br /><br />Additionally, Mary has now illustrated six beatiful children's books and is at work on the seventh. Her book illustration possesses higly personalized lyrical story interpretations and has received very favorable reviews in the national press.<br /><br />It is unusual for an illustrator to work successfully in so many genres of illustration at one time, from advertising and corporate to editorial and children's books. Her reputation is now world renown for her delightfully stunning illustrations.<br />",

Hitchhiker's began on radio, and developed into a \"trilogy\" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a television series, a comic book series, a computer game, and a feature film that was completed after Adams' death. The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams. He was known to some fans as Bop Ad (after his illegible signature), or by his initials \"DNA\".<br /><br />In addition to <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the Dirk Gently novels, and he co-wrote two Liff books and <i>Last Chance to See</i>, itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game <i>Starship Titanic</i>, which was produced by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by Terry Jones. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359.The_Salmon_of_Doubt\" title=\"The Salmon of Doubt\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Salmon of Doubt</a>\n</i> in 2002.<br /><br />His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the Macintosh computer, and other \"techno gizmos\". <br /><br />Toward the end of his life he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment.",

Lewis</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9533.Christopher_Tolkien\" title=\"Christopher Tolkien\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christopher Tolkien</a> published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7332.The_Silmarillion\" title=\"The Silmarillion\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Silmarillion</a>\n</i>. These, together with <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the word \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings. <br /><br />While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature\u2014or more precisely, high fantasy. Tolkien's writings have inspired many other works of fantasy and have had a lasting effect on the entire field.<br /><br />In 2008, <i>The Times</i> ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". <i>Forbes</i> ranked him the 5th top-earning dead celebrity in 2009.<br /><br /><b>Religious influences</b><br />J.R.R. Tolkien, was born in South Africa in 1892, but his family moved to Britain when he was about 3 years old. When Tolkien was 8 years old, his mother converted to Catholicism, and he remained a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, \u201cI\u2019m a devout Roman Catholic.\u201d <br /><br />Tolkien married his childhood sweetheart, Edith, and they had four children. He wrote them letters each year as if from Santa Claus, and a selection of these was published in 1976 as <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7331.The_Father_Christmas_Letters\" title=\"The Father Christmas Letters\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Father Christmas Letters</a>\n</i>. One of Tolkien\u2019s sons became a Catholic priest. Tolkien was an advisor for the translation of the <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108930.Jerusalem_Bible\" title=\"Jerusalem Bible\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jerusalem Bible</a>\n</i>. <br /><br />Tolkien once described <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> to his friend Robert Murray, an English Jesuit priest, as \"a fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.\" There are many theological themes underlying the narrative including the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of grace. In addition the saga includes themes which incorporate death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self-sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. In addition <i>The Lord's Prayer</i> \"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" was reportedly present in Tolkien's mind as he described Frodo's struggles against the power of the \"One Ring.''",

First published under Red Sage, she was able to write romantic fiction for the first time in 1996. She published several short stories in their Secrets anthologies. Editor Cindy Hwang brought her to Berkley Publishing and has helped her become a best selling author.<br /><br />When developing her Mageverse series she wanted to create a unique spin on the vampire tale. Taking the Arthurian legend and twisting it, she has vampires that are not evil, still possess their souls, and can reproduce. Merlin was an alien who traveled to Earth from the Mageverse (an alternate world where magic is everywhere) to establish protectors. Merlin's race had seen species that destroyed themselves as they advanced. To avoid this, he searched Earth for worthy men and women who would give everything to protect others. After drinking from the Grail, men became Magi, vampires and women became Majae, witches. They have a symbiotic relationship. The Magi have to drink blood from the Majae to help absorb the energies of the Mageverse. The Majae have to donate blood or they will suffer heart attack from excess blood and elevated pressure. The Majae are the magic in the Mageverse. The Magi also sleep during the day as another means of gaining magic. The men and women could theoretically live forever, should they not be killed.<br /><br />They are capable of reproducing with mortals to ensure that there are more potential candidates to recruit. Anyone born of such a union is a Latent. Their Gift, becoming Magi or Majae, is triggered by three or sexual encounters with a Gifted man or woman. A Latent must be approved by the Magi or Majae councils. Many can not psychologically handle the impact of the Mageverse (It can trigger insanity). There are professional court seducers who Gift latents on the Councils orders.<br /><br />On Mageverse Earth, there are Fairies, Dragons, Unicorns and the city of Avalon where the Magi and Majae live. They magically create gates to travel to Realspace Earth. The Fairies are featured in Master of the Moon, which has King Llyr of the Faeries.<br /><br />Merlin, who knows that power can corrupt, created another magical species in case the Magi and Majae become out of control. These are werewolves. They do not have to wait until the full moon to change. They are a rigid society that has been hidden from their inception. In Master of Wolves, the werewolves declare themselves and fight alongside the Magi and the Fairies.<br /><br />Master of Swords introduces the dragons of Mageverse in more depth and the hero for Master of Dragons is introduced.<br /><br />Futuristic Books<br /><br />Jane's Warlord introduces Jane Colby, a 20th century reporter. Baran Arvid is sent back from the future to protect her from another time traveler, Druas. Druas travels back in time to commit the Jack the Ripper murders and his next target is Jane. Baran is a technologically and genetically enhanced human classified as a Warlord.<br /><br />Mercenaires is three short stories (originally published electronically) set in a future like Baran\u2019s. They can be technologically and genetically enhanced. Space travel has extended to other galaxies and other life forms have been discovered. Humans have established many new colonies on planets capable of sustaining life.",

There are forests, castles, and lords or kings, minstrels, tinkers and wizards. Her writing usually puts her characters in situations involving mysterious powers that they don't understand. Many of her characters aren't even sure of their own ancestry. Music often plays an important role. Love between family members is also important in McKillip's writing, although members of her families often disagree.",

        "biography": "Beverly Cleary (born April 12, 1916) is the author of over 30 books for young adults and children. Her characters are normal children facing challenges that many of us face growing up, and her stories are liberally laced with humour. Some of her best known and loved characters are Ramona Quimby and her sister Beatrice (\"Beezus\"), Henry Huggins, and Ralph S. Mouse.<br /><br />Beverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn in McMinnville, Oregon. When she was 6, her family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she went to grammar and high school. She was slow in learning to read, due partly to her dissatisfaction with the books she was required to read and partly to an unpleasant first grade teacher. It wasn't until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books, when she started reading The Dutch Twins by Lucy Fitch Perkins. Thereafter, she was a frequent visitor to the library, though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read \u2014 those about children like herself.<br /><br />She moved to California to attend the University of California, Berkeley, and after graduation with a B.A in English in 1938, studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939. Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima, Washington, where she met many children who were searching for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself. In response, she wrote her first book, Henry Huggins, which was published in 1950. Beezus and Ramona, Cleary's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story, was published in 1955, although Beezus and Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins series as supporting characters.<br /><br />In 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland, California. The Clearys became parents to a set of twins, Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James, in 1955. Clarence Cleary died in 2004. Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel, California.<br /><br />She has also written two autobiographies, A Girl from Yamhill and My Own Two Feet.",

        "biography": "Yes, I have a lot of books, and if this is your first visit to my amazon author page, it can be a little overwhelming. If you are new to my work, let me recommend a few titles as good places to start. I love my Dan Shamble, Zombie P.I. series, humorous horror/mysteries, which begin with DEATH WARMED OVER. My steampunk fantasy adventures, CLOCKWORK ANGELS and CLOCKWORK LIVES, written with Neil Peart, legendary drummer from Rush, are two of my very favorite novels ever. And my magnum opus, the science fiction epic The Saga of Seven Suns, begins with HIDDEN EMPIRE. After you've tried those, I hope you'll check out some of my other series.<br /><br />I have written spin-off novels for Star Wars, StarCraft, Titan A.E., and The X-Files, and I'm the co-author of the Dune prequels. My original works include the Saga of Seven Suns series and the Nebula Award-nominated Assemblers of Infinity. I have also written several comic books including the Dark Horse Star Wars collection Tales of the Jedi written in collaboration with Tom Veitch, Predator titles (also for Dark Horse), and X-Files titles for Topps.<br /><br />I serve as a judge in the Writers of the Future contest.<br /><br />My wife is author Rebecca Moesta. We currently reside near Monument, Colorado.<br />",

At the age of five I was sent to a boarding school which might be better described as a combination orphanage and reform school, where I learned to box - though less as a sport and more as a means to stay alive.<br /><br />But I survived to return to a small mountain town named Barberton in the North Eastern part of the country.<br /><br />Here I met Doc, a drunken German music teacher who spent the next few years filling my young mind with the wonders of nature as we roamed the high mountains. His was the best education I was ever to receive, despite the scholarship I won to a prestigious boy's school and thereafter to a university in England where I studied Journalism.<br /><br />I came to Australia because I was banned from returning to my own country.<br /><br />This was due to the fact that I had started a weekend school for Africans in the school hall of the prestigious boy's school I attended.<br /><br />One day the school hall was raided by the police who then branded me a Communist as they considered educating Africans a subversive act.<br /><br />While studying journalism, I met a wonderful Australian girl.<br /><br />\"Come to my country!\" Benita invited.<br /><br />I did, and soon after arriving in Australia, married her. Benita gave me three splendid sons, Brett, Adam and Damon. Brett, who married Ann has given me three lovely grandsons, Ben now 14, Jake is about to turn 12 and Marcus is almost 6 years old.<br /><br />I have lived all my Australian life in Sydney (the nicest place on earth) and, until I started writing fiction, made my career in advertising working as a copywriter and creative director.<br /><br />At the age of 55 I decided to take the plunge. I had been telling stories since the age of five and had always known I would be a writer some day, though life kept getting in the way until I realised that it was either now or never.<br /><br />Bryce Courtenay died at his home in Canberra, Australia. He was 79.<br /><br />Courtenay is survived by his second wife Christine Gee and his children Adam and Brett.",

He was educated at home and at a private school. Shortly after the death of his mother in 1837 he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Army Engineering College. Dostoyevsky's father died in 1839, most likely of apoplexy, but it was rumored that he was murdered by his own serfs. Dostoyevsky graduated as a military engineer, but resigned in 1844 to devote himself to writing. His first novel, <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67326.Poor_Folk\" title=\"Poor Folk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poor Folk</a>\n</i> appeared in 1846.<br /><br />That year he joined a group of utopian socialists. He was arrested in 1849 and sentenced to death, commuted to imprisonment in Siberia. Dostoyevsky spent four years in hard labor and four years as a soldier in Semipalatinsk, a city in what it is today Kazakhstan.<br /><br />Dostoyevsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1854 as a writer with a religious mission and published three works that derive in different ways from his Siberia experiences: <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17877.The_House_of_the_Dead\" title=\"The House of the Dead\" rel=\"nofollow\">The House of the Dead</a>\n</i>, (1860) a fictional account of prison life, <i>The Insulted and Injured</i>, which reflects the author's refutation of naive Utopianism in the face of evil, and <i>Winter Notes on Summer Impressions</i>, his account of a trip to Western Europe.<br /><br />In 1857 Dostoyevsky married Maria Isaev, a 29-year old widow. He resigned from the army two years later. Between the years 1861 and 1863 he served as editor of the monthly periodical <i>Time</i>, which was later suppressed because of an article on the Polish uprising.<br /><br />In 1864-65 his wife and brother died and he was burdened with debts. His situation was made even worse by his gambling addiction. From the turmoil of the 1860s emerged <i>Notes from the Underground</i>, a psychological study of an outsider, which marked a major advancement in Dostoyevsky's artistic and creative development.<br /><br />In 1867 Dostoyevsky married Anna Snitkin, his 22-year old stenographer. They traveled abroad and returned in 1871. By the time of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> (1879-80), Dostoyevsky was recognized in his own country as one of its great writers.<br /><br />",

Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works, the novels <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world's greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.<br /><br />His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as <i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i>, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.",

His humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel <i>Howards End</i>: \"Only connect\".<br /><br />He had five novels published in his lifetime, achieving his greatest success with <i>A Passage to India</i> (1924) which takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. <br /><br />Forster's views as a secular humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. He is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised for his attachment to mysticism. His other works include <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> (1905), <i>The Longest Journey</i> (1907), <i>A Room with a View</i> (1908) and <i>Maurice</i> (1971), his posthumously published novel which tells of the coming of age of an explicitly gay male character.",

He is the youngest of three siblings; his older brother Vincent is also a novelist and has written under the name Vincent Lawrence as well as his own. His sister Vonnie Banville-Evans has written both a children's novel and a reminiscence of growing up in Wexford.<br /><br />Educated at a Christian Brothers' school and at St Peter's College in Wexford. Despite having intended to be a painter and an architect he did not attend university. Banville has described this as \"A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free.\" After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus which allowed him to travel at deeply-discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland he became a sub-editor at the Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor. His first book, Long Lankin, was published in 1970.<br /><br />After the Irish Press collapsed in 1995, he became a sub-editor at the Irish Times. He was appointed literary editor in 1998. The Irish Times, too, suffered severe financial problems, and Banville was offered the choice of taking a redundancy package or working as a features department sub-editor. He left. Banville has been a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books since 1990. In 1984, he was elected to Aosd\u00e1na, but resigned in 2001, so that some other artist might be allowed to receive the cnuas.<br /><br />Banville also writes under the pen name <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/116405.Benjamin_Black\" title=\"Benjamin Black\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benjamin Black</a>. His first novel under this pen name was Christine Falls, which was followed by The Silver Swan in 2007. Banville has two adult sons with his wife, the American textile artist Janet Dunham. They met during his visit to San Francisco in 1968 where she was a student at the University of California, Berkeley. Dunham described him during the writing process as being like \"a murderer who's just come back from a particularly bloody killing\". Banville has two daughters from his relationship with Patricia Quinn, former head of the Arts Council of Ireland.<br /><br />Banville has a strong interest in vivisection and animal rights, and is often featured in Irish media speaking out against vivisection in Irish university research.",

He is the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy at Yeshiva University, director of the Yeshiva Center for History and Philosophy of Science, and a professor at Johns Hopkins University.<br /><br />Achinstein received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard with a dissertation on Carnap's theory of probability. It was the German philosopher Carl G. Hempel, in a visit to Harvard in 1953\u20134 (replacing W.V. Quine who was on leave), that motivated him to pursue Philosophy of Science. Upon getting a Harvard Traveling Fellowship, Achinstein spent a year in Oxford in 1959 working under the guidance of P. F. Strawson. In Oxford he attended seminars and lectures delivered by Gilbert Ryle, A.J. Ayer, and J.L. Austin. Achinstein specializes in philosophy of science with strong interests in the history of science.<br /><br />Achinstein has taught for many years at Johns Hopkins University, where he is currently Professor of Philosophy. In Spring 2009, Achinstein began teaching at Yeshiva University as the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy and is the founder and director of the Center for History and Philosophy of Science of Yeshiva University, New York. He returned to Johns Hopkins in Spring 2011. He has held Guggenheim, NEH, and NSF fellowships, and has served as a visiting professor at MIT, Stanford, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br /><br />He is the author of five influential books in the history and philosophy of science. Among them are <i>Particles and Waves</i>, which received the prestigious Lakatos Award in 1993. This book is a study of methodological problems arising from three episodes in 19th century physics: the wave-particle debate about light, the development of the kinetic-molecular theory, and the discovery of the electron. In 2001, Achinstein published <i>The Book of Evidence</i>, a philosophical and historical study of various concepts of evidence employed in the sciences. A volume of his important collected essays over the years, <i>Evidence, Explanation, and Realism</i>, was published in the spring of 2010. A special volume honoring him, <i>Philosophy of Science Matters: The Philosophy of Peter Achinstein</i>, was published in 2011. In 2013, Achinstein published <i>Evidence and Method: Scientific Strategies of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell</i>.<br /><br /><i>Wikipedia</i>",

Her works reflect her strong interest in modern science: tesseracts, for example, are featured prominently in <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, mitochondrial DNA in <i>A Wind in the Door</i>, organ regeneration in <i>The Arm of the Starfish</i>, and so forth.<br /><br />\"Madeleine was born on November 29th, 1918, and spent her formative years in New York City. Instead of her school work, she found that she would much rather be writing stories, poems and journals for herself, which was reflected in her grades (not the best). However, she was not discouraged.<br /><br />At age 12, she moved to the French Alps with her parents and went to an English boarding school where, thankfully, her passion for writing continued to grow. She flourished during her high school years back in the United States at Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, vacationing with her mother in a rambling old beach cottage on a beautiful stretch of Florida beach.<br /><br />She went to Smith College and studied English with some wonderful teachers as she read the classics and continued her own creative writing. She graduated with honors and moved into a Greenwich Village apartment in New York. She worked in the theater, where Equity union pay and a flexible schedule afforded her the time to write! She published her first two novels during these years\u2014<i>A Small Rain</i> and <i>Ilsa</i>\u2014before meeting Hugh Franklin, her future husband, when she was an understudy in Anton Chekov's <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. They married during <i>The Joyous Season</i>.<br /><br />She had a baby girl and kept on writing, eventually moving to Connecticut to raise the family away from the city in a small dairy farm village with more cows than people. They bought a dead general store, and brought it to life for 9 years. They moved back to the city with three children, and Hugh revitalized his professional acting career. The family has kept the country house, Crosswicks, and continues to spend summers there.<br /><br />As the years passed and the children grew, Madeleine continued to write and Hugh to act, and they to enjoy each other and life. Madeleine began her association with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where she has been the librarian and maintained an office for more than thirty years. After Hugh's death in 1986, it was her writing and lecturing that kept her going. She has now lived through the 20th century and into the 21st and has written over 60 books and keeps writing. She enjoys being with her friends, her children, her grandchildren, and her great grandchildren.\"<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/madeleinelengle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/author/madele...</a><br /><br />Copyright \u00a9 2007 Crosswicks, Ltd.

        "biography": "Charles Willeford was a remarkably fine, talented and prolific writer who wrote everything from poetry to crime fiction to literary criticism throughout the course of his impressively long and diverse career. His crime novels are distinguished by a mean'n'lean sense of narrative economy and an admirable dearth of sentimentality. He was born as Charles Ray Willeford III on January 2, 1919 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Willeford's parents both died of tuberculosis when he was a little boy and he subsequently lived either with his grandmother or at boarding schools. Charles became a hobo in his early teens. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps at age sixteen and was stationed in the Philippines. Willeford served as a tank commander with the 10th Armored Division in Europe during World War II. He won several medals for his military service: the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, and the Luxembourg Croix de Guerre. Charles retired from the army as a Master Sergeant. Willeford's first novel \"High Priest of California\" was published in 1953. This solid debut was followed by such equally excellent novels as \"Pick-Up\" (this book won a Beacon Fiction Award), \"Wild Wives,\" \"The Woman Chaser,\" \"Cockfighter\" (this particular book won the Mark Twain Award), and \"The Burnt Orange Heresy.\" Charles achieved his greatest commercial and critical success with four outstanding novels about hapless Florida homicide detective Hoke Moseley: \"Miami Blues,\" \"New Hope for the Dead,\" \"Sideswipe,\" and \"The Way We Die Now.\" Outside of his novels, he also wrote the short story anthology \"The Machine in Ward Eleven,\" the poetry collections \"The Outcast Poets\" and \"Proletarian Laughter,\" and the nonfiction book \"Something About A Soldier.\" Willeford attended both Palm Beach Junior College and the University of Miami. He taught a course in humanities at the University of Miami and was an associate professor who taught classes in both philosophy and English at Miami Dade Junior College. Charles was married three times and was an associate editor for \"Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine.\" Three of Willeford's novels have been adapted into movies: Monte Hellman delivered a bleakly fascinating character study with \"Cockfighter\" (Charles wrote the script and has a sizable supporting role as the referee of a cockfighting tournament which climaxes the picture), George Armitage hit one out of the ballpark with the wonderfully quirky \"Miami Blues,\" and Robinson Devor scored a bull's eye with the offbeat \"The Woman Chaser.\" Charles popped up in a small part as a bartender in the fun redneck car chase romp \"Thunder and Lightning.\" Charles Willeford died of a heart attack at age 69 on March 27, 1988.",

He has published in excess (oh, wretched excess!) of 100 books, and no end of short stories.<br /><br />Born in Buffalo, N.Y., LB attended Antioch College, but left before completing his studies; school authorities advised him that they felt he\u2019d be happier elsewhere, and he thought this was remarkably perceptive of them.<br /><br />His earliest work, published pseudonymously in the late 1950s, was mostly in the field of midcentury erotica, an apprenticeship he shared with Donald E. Westlake and Robert Silverberg. The first time Lawrence Block\u2019s name appeared in print was when his short story \u201cYou Can\u2019t Lose\u201d was published in the February 1958 issue of Manhunt. The first book published under his own name was Mona (1961); it was reissued several times over the years, once as Sweet Slow Death. In 2005 it became the first offering from Hard Case Crime, and bore for the first time LB\u2019s original title, Grifter\u2019s Game.<br /><br />LB is best known for his series characters, including cop-turned-private investigator Matthew Scudder, gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, globe-trotting insomniac Evan Tanner, and introspective assassin Keller.<br /><br />Because one name is never enough, LB has also published under pseudonyms including Jill Emerson, John Warren Wells, Lesley Evans, and Anne Campbell Clarke.<br /><br />LB\u2019s magazine appearances include American Heritage, Redbook, Playboy, Linn\u2019s Stamp News, Cosmopolitan, GQ, and The New York Times. His monthly instructional column ran in Writer\u2019s Digest for 14 years, and led to a string of books for writers, including the classics Telling Lies for Fun &amp; Profit and The Liar\u2019s Bible. He has also written episodic television (Tilt!) and the Wong Kar-wai film, My Blueberry Nights.<br /><br />Several of LB\u2019s books have been filmed. The latest, A Walk Among the Tombstones, stars Liam Neeson as Matthew Scudder and is scheduled for release in September, 2014.<br /><br />LB is a Grand Master of Mystery Writers of America, and a past president of MWA and the Private Eye Writers of America. He has won the Edgar and Shamus awards four times each, and the Japanese Maltese Falcon award twice, as well as the Nero Wolfe and Philip Marlowe awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, and the Diamond Dagger for Life Achievement from the Crime Writers Association (UK). He\u2019s also been honored with the Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award from Mystery Ink magazine and the Edward D. Hoch Memorial Golden Derringer for Lifetime Achievement in the short story. In France, he has been proclaimed a Grand Maitre du Roman Noir and has twice been awarded the Societe 813 trophy. He has been a guest of honor at Bouchercon and at book fairs and mystery festivals in France, Germany, Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Taiwan. As if that were not enough, he was also presented with the key to the city of Muncie, Indiana. (But as soon as he left, they changed the locks.)<br /><br />LB and his wife Lynne are enthusiastic New Yorkers and relentless world travelers; the two are members of the Travelers Century Club, and have visited around 160 countries.<br /><br />He is a modest and humble fellow, although you would never guess as much from this biographical note.",

In addition, Westlake also earned a Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1993. <br /><br />Westlake's cinematic prose and brisk dialogue made his novels attractive to Hollywood, and several motion pictures were made from his books, with stars such as Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson. Westlake wrote several screenplays himself, receiving an Academy Award nomination for his adaptation of The Grifters, Jim Thompson's noir classic.<br /><br /><br />",

Since then he has become well known for his brightly colored artwork and dynamic collages. Among the many children's books he has illustrated are the Candlewick Press titles HOWDI DO, BLING BLANG, and MY DOLLY, in which his vibrant images bring to life the nursery songs of folk-singing legend Woody Guthrie--tunes that appealed to him because they reminded him of songs he loved as a child growing up in Russia.<br /><br />In collaboration with fellow illustrator Chris Raschka, Vladimir Radunsky wrote and illustrated a rather unique collection of tongue-in-cheek advice on a very important topic: TABLE MANNERS. Through their alter egos Dudunya (Vladimir) and Chester (Chris), the pair share their considerable wisdom in a how-to guide to mealtime behavior. The artist moved on to explore the world of shapes in SQUARE TRIANGLE ROUND SKINNY, a boxed set of fun, funky board books featuring his brilliant graphics.<br /><br /><br />\"I don't pick the medium I work in, but rather it just happens,\" he says. \"And most of the elements I use are repeated in various combinations. Recently I came across a story by Hans Christian Andersen. In it, I found this thought that pretty closely resembles my work principle: 'Ah, godfather could really tell fairy tales--they were long and plentiful. And at Christmastime he would take a thick, blank album and paste in it pictures that he cut out of books and newspapers. When he could not find a picture that fitted the story, he would draw one.'\" <br /><br /><br />Vladimir Radunsky now lives in Rome, Italy.<br />",

She says, \"I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real.\" <br />As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. \"It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain,\" she says. \"I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting.\" <br />Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. \"From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books.\" <br />--from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.janbrett.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.janbrett.com</a>",

See also <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4191.Emily_Bront_\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emily Bront\u00eb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8249.Anne_Bront_\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anne Bront\u00eb</a>.<br /><br />Charlotte Bront\u00eb was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, England, the third of six children, to Patrick Bront\u00eb (formerly \"Patrick Brunty\"), an Irish Anglican clergyman, and his wife, Maria Branwell. In April 1820 the family moved a few miles to Haworth, a remote town on the Yorkshire moors, where Patrick had been appointed Perpetual Curate. This is where the Bront\u00eb children would spend most of their lives. Maria Branwell Bront\u00eb died from what was thought to be cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters and a son to the care of her spinster sister Elizabeth Branwell, who moved to Yorkshire to help the family.<br /><br />In August 1824 Charlotte, along with her sisters Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth, was sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire, a new school for the daughters of poor clergyman (which she would describe as Lowood School in Jane Eyre). The school was a horrific experience for the girls and conditions were appalling. They were regularly deprived of food, beaten by teachers and humiliated for the slightest error. The school was unheated and the pupils slept two to a bed for warmth. Seven pupils died in a typhus epidemic that swept the school and all four of the Bront\u00eb girls became very ill - Maria and Elizabeth dying of tuberculosis in 1825. Her experiences at the school deeply affected Bront\u00eb - her health never recovered and she immortalised the cruel and brutal treatment in her novel, <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Following the tragedy, their father withdrew his daughters from the school.<br /><br />At home in Haworth Parsonage, Charlotte and the other surviving children \u2014 Branwell, Emily, and Anne \u2014 continued their ad-hoc education. In 1826 her father returned home with a box of toy soldiers for Branwell. They would prove the catalyst for the sisters' extraordinary creative development as they immediately set to creating lives and characters for the soldiers, inventing a world for them which the siblings called 'Angria'. The siblings became addicted to writing, creating stories, poetry and plays. Bront\u00eb later said that the reason for this burst of creativity was that:<br /><br />'We were wholly dependent on ourselves and each other, on books and study, for the enjoyments and occupations of life. The highest stimulus, as well as the liveliest pleasure we had known from childhood upwards, lay in attempts at literary composition.'<br /><br />After her father began to suffer from a lung disorder, Charlotte was again sent to school to complete her education at Roe Head school in Mirfield from 1831 to 1832, where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents, Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor. During this period (1833), she wrote her novella The Green Dwarf under the name of Wellesley. The school was extremely small with only ten pupils meaning the top floor was completely unused and believed to be supposedly haunted by the ghost of a young lady dressed in silk. This story fascinated Bront\u00eb and inspired the figure of Mrs Rochester in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.<br /><br />Bront\u00eb left the school after a few years, however she swiftly returned in 1835 to take up a position as a teacher, and used her wages to pay for Emily and Anne to be taught at the school. However, teaching did not appeal to Bront\u00eb and in 1838 she left Roe Head to become a governess to the Sidgewick family - this was partly from a sense of adventure and a desire to see the world, and partly from financial necessity. <br /><br />Charlotte became pregnant soon after her wedding, but her health declined rapidly and, according to Gaskell, she was attacked by \"sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness.\" She died, with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, aged 38. .",

Goffman's other areas of study included social order and interaction, impression management, total institutions, social organization of experience, and stigmas. Some of the influences on his works include Durkheim, Freud, Mead, Radcliffe-Brown, and Simmel.<br /><br />In 2007 Goffman was listed as the 6th most-cited intellectual in the humanities and social sciences by The Times Higher Education Guide, behind Anthony Giddens and ahead of J\u00fcrgen Habermas.[1]. Goffman was also named the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association. Goffman is more cited today from his books than during his time. Writers today use his ideas to examine the relationship between individual behavior and the reproduction of social systems.<br />",

        "biography": "Henry James, OM, son of theologian Henry James Sr., brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author, one of the founders and leaders of a school of realism in fiction. He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death. He is primarily known for a series of major novels in which he portrayed the encounter of America with Europe. His plots centered on personal relationships, the proper exercise of power in such relationships, and other moral questions. His method of writing from the point of view of a character within a tale allowed him to explore the phenomena of consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting.<br />James insisted that writers in Great Britain and America should be allowed the greatest freedom possible in presenting their view of the world, as French authors were. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and unreliable narrators in his own novels and tales brought a new depth and interest to realistic fiction, and foreshadowed the modernist work of the twentieth century. An extraordinarily productive writer, in addition to his voluminous works of fiction he published articles and books of travel writing, biography, autobiography, and criticism,and wrote plays, some of which were performed during his lifetime with moderate success. His theatrical work is thought to have profoundly influenced his later novels and tales.",

        "biography": "<b>Marguerite Donnadieu</b>, better known as <b>Marguerite Duras</b> (pronounced [ma\u0280g\u0259\u0281it dy\u02c8\u0281as] in French) (April 4, 1914 \u2013 March 3, 1996) was a French writer and film director.<br /><br />She was born at Gia-Dinh, near Saigon, French Indochina (now Vietnam), after her parents responded to a campaign by the French government encouraging people to work in the colony.<br /><br />Marguerite's father fell ill soon after their arrival, and returned to France, where he died. After his death, her mother, a teacher, remained in Indochina with her three children. The family lived in relative poverty after a bad investment in an isolated property and area of farmland in Cambodia(t\u00eate de pisse). The difficult life that the family experienced during this period was highly influential on Marguerite's later work.<br /><br />At 17, Marguerite went to France, her parents' native country, where she began studying for a degree in mathematics. This she soon abandoned to concentrate on political sciences, and then law. After completing her studies, she became an active member of the PCF (the French Communist Party) and was engaged in the resistance.<br /><br />In 1943 she changed her surname to \"Duras\" for Duras, the name of a village in the Lot-et-Garonne d\u00e9partement, where her father's house was located.<br /><br />She is the author of a great many novels, plays, films, interviews and short narratives, including her best-selling, apparently autobiographical work L'Amant (1984), translated into English as The Lover. This text won the Goncourt prize in 1984. The story of her adolescence also appears in three other forms: The Sea Wall, Eden Cinema and The North China Lover. A film version of The Lover, produced by Claude Berri, was released to great success in 1992.<br /><br />Other major works include Moderato Cantabile, also made into a film of the same name, Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein, and her film India Song. She was also the screenwriter of the 1959 French film Hiroshima mon amour, which was directed by Alain Resnais.<br /><br />Duras's early novels were fairly conventional in form (their 'romanticism' was criticised by fellow writer Raymond Queneau); however, with Moderato Cantabile she became more experimental, paring down her texts to give ever-increasing importance to what was not said. She was associated with the Nouveau roman French literary movement, although did not definitively belong to any group. Her films are also experimental in form, most eschewing synch sound, using voice over to allude to, rather than tell, a story over images whose relation to what is said may be more-or-less tangential.<br /><br />Marguerite's adult life was somewhat difficult, despite her success as a writer, and she was known for her periods of alcoholism. She died in Paris, aged 82 from throat cancer and is interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. Her tomb is marked simply 'MD'.<br /><br />From wikipedia",

In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero. <br />He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book <i>The Prophet</i>, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. <br />Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Lao-Tzu.",

It is only recently that critics have begun to look beyond Stevenson's popularity and allow him a place in the Western canon.",

        "biography": "Mary Ann Evans, known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She was born in 1819 at a farmstead in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, where her father was estate manager. Mary Ann, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good education for a young woman of her day. Influenced by a favorite governess, she became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. <br /><br />Her first published work was a religious poem. Through a family friend, she was exposed to Charles Hennell's \"An Inquiry into the Origins of Christianity\". Unable to believe, she conscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. Her father shunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister until she promised to reexamine her feelings. Her intellectual views did not, however, change. She translated \"Das Leben Jesu\", a monumental task, without signing her name to the 1846 work. <br /><br />After her father's death in 1849, Mary Ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with The Westminster Review. Despite a heavy workload, she translated \"The Essence of Christianity\", the only book ever published under her real name. That year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized British society by sending notices to friends announcing she had entered a free \"union\" with George Henry Lewes, editor of The Leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. They lived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social ostracism and financial hardship. She became salaried and began writing essays and reviews for The Westminster Review. <br /><br />Renaming herself \"Marian\" in private life and adopting the penname \"George Eliot,\" she began her impressive fiction career, including: \"Adam Bede\" (1859), \"The Mill on the Floss\" (1860), \"Silas Marner\" (1861), \"Romola\" (1863), and \"Middlemarch\" (1871). Themes included her humanist vision and strong heroines. Her poem, \"O May I Join the Choir Invisible\" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: \"O may I join the choir invisible/ Of those immortal dead who live again/ In minds made better by their presence. . .\" D. 1880.<br /><br />Her 1872 work Middlemarch has been described by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.<br /><br />More: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/eliot_george.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184688/George-Eliot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/t...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/authors/eliot/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/george-eliot-9286017\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biography.com/people/georg...</a><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/deronda/ei_eliot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/d...</a>",

Garc\u00ed\u00ada M\u00e1rquez, familiarly known as \"Gabo\" in his native country, was considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />He studied at the University of Bogot\u00e1 and later worked as a reporter for the Colombian newspaper <i>El Espectador</i> and as a foreign correspondent in Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Caracas and New York. He wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (1967) and <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in order to explain real experiences. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude.<br /><br />Having previously written shorter fiction and screenplays, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sequestered himself away in his Mexico City home for an extended period of time to complete his novel <i>Cien a\u00f1os de soledad</i>, or <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, published in 1967. The author drew international acclaim for the work, which ultimately sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez is credited with helping introduce an array of readers to magical realism, a genre that combines more conventional storytelling forms with vivid, layered fantasy.<br /><br />Another one of his novels, <i>El amor</i> en <i>los tiempos del c\u00f3lera</i> (1985), or <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, drew a large global audience as well. The work was partially based on his parents' courtship and was adapted into a 2007 film starring Javier Bardem. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote seven novels during his life, with additional titles including <i>El general en su laberinto (1989)</i>, or <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>, and <i>Del amor y otros demonios (1994)</i>, or <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i>.<br /><br />(Arabic: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5029628._\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632</a>) (Hebrew: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7091051._\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d2\u05d0\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05e8\u05e7\u05e1</a>)",

        "biography": "Theodor Seuss Geisel was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, MA. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vaction in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During WW II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published The Cat in the Hat, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was Green Eggs and Ham. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name:<br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/398177.Theo_Le_Sieg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theo Le Sieg</a>",

In 1960, he was also among the first to receive a Fulbright fellowship for the Arabic study, traveling to Cairo to learn Arabic. After a period of study in the University of Tehran, he completed his doctorate in Iranian history from Princeton University in 1974 under the supervision of Martin B. Dickson. In 1970 he first came to teach at University of Chicago, and quickly distinguished himself as a leading scholar of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. Professor Woods focuses primarily on the history of Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia from the 13th to 18th century. He is particularly interested in aspects of the encounter of sedentary and nomadic people in those regions during that time period. He is at present working on several projects dealing with the age of Chinggis Khan and Timur (Tamerlane). He has played a central role in the Center for Middle Eastern Studies since 1980, serving four terms as director.

        "biography": "Today, almost every perfume is created from synthetic essences. Although synthetics approximate the odors of natural ingredients, they have none of the complexity, mystery or emotional depth. We bring an inexplicable emotional intensity to the experience of an authentic smell and the memories it sparks and creates. <br /><br />My approach to creating artisan natural perfumes is based in the quality and integrity of the ingredients. I hand blend each perfume from my collection of extraordinary essences, which I have gathered with uncompromising standards for only the finest quality 100% pure and natural materials. I seek out exotic, unusual essences from hidden corners of the world, often smelling a dozen versions of the same oil, searching for the one that surpasses the rest. Finding the essences is like a quest, and I enjoy it as much as the act of creation. Through years of searching I have amassed a comprehensive and strikingly beautiful palette from which to work. <br /><br />In each perfume, I try to capture a feeling and aesthetic experience. I start with a concept for the perfume, and work to create something modern and luxurious. With some perfumes, the first iteration is almost perfect. Others take endless revisions and weeks of blending until everything comes together in the ideal balance. <br /><br />Once the formulas are developed, I hand blend small batches of perfume, and bottle it in the same studio it was created in. I am connected to the whole process, and it makes me very happy when people incorporate my perfumes in their lives. It is my hope that people have a feeling of luxury, well-being, beauty and excitement when they wear Aftelier Perfumes. <br /><br />In addition to my work as a perfumer, I am the author of six books, three of which are on natural perfume. <i>Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume</i> has been translated into seven languages and was the winner of The Sense of Smell Institute's Richard B. Solomon Award. <i>Aroma</i>, a cookbook (co-authored with chef Daniel Patterson), focuses on the essential link between food and fragrance and includes recipes for both. <i>Scents &amp; Sensibilities</i> guides the reader through the history and creation of solid perfumes. <br /><br />My three other books are <i>The Story of Your Life: Becoming the Author of Your Experience</i>, <i>When Talk is Not Cheap</i> and <i>Death of a Rolling Stone: The Brian Jones Story</i>. <br /><br />In early 2009, Living Perfume: The Natural Alchemy of Mandy Aftel, debuted at the Fifth Avenue store, Henri Bendel. The exhibit focused on education and the history of perfumery. It showcased my perfumes as well as my extraordinary collection of perfume memorabilia. The event was commemorated in a catalogue, which can be viewed here. <br /><br />As the curator for an exhibition on the history of natural perfume The Foul and the Fragrant: Creating Natural Perfume at the Doheny Memorial Library, University of Southern California I displayed turn-of-the-century perfume books and vintage memorabilia from my private collection. My artistry with natural perfumery was the subject of the exhibit, Constructing Perfume: Scent, Space, Color at 3A Gallery in San Francisco, which included architectural renderings of my fragrances, and an interactive experience of viewers matching color chips to scents. <br /><br />In 2004, I was invited to create a perfume for a 2000 year old child mummy in conjunction with the Stanford Medical Center, the Rosicrucian Museum and Silicon Graphics (SGI). <br /><br />In addition to my work with Michelin-starred chef Daniel Patterson (Coi Restaurant), I have worked with Daniel Barber (Blue Hill, Blue Hill at Stone Barns), Johnny Iuzinni (Jean Georges), and other chefs. I have conducted classes and demonstrations for vintners and sommeliers, and at the University of Southern California, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Ideo, Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, Apple, Clif Bar, the James Beard Foundation, New York University, Slow Food, London Design Festival, Esalen Ins",

        "biography": "Before a dramatic mid-life course correction while in Japan, young Michael Justin Sullivan had been a sailing captain, delivering yachts from the Northeast to Fort Lauderdale, the Bahamas and beyond into the Caribbean. These were the last days of canvas sail, teak decks and navigating by sextant, a time in the \u201850s and \u201860s when Ft. Lauderdale was still a sleepy Florida city and there were but a few paved roads on the Out Islands.<br /><br />This is the era captured by Three-Strand Cordage, a novel of one man\u2019s life in three interwoven tales. Against the tranquil background of this vanished era, he finds himself caught up in kidnapping and a murderous shootout, deceived and betrayed in a gun-smuggling plot by anti-Castro Cubans, and fleeing from drug smugglers with his daughter, only to sail into Hurricane Agnes.<br />In his mid-30s, M.J. Sullivan became a champion Japanese swordsman. As Seiho his calligraphy has twice won the Kamp\u014d Prize, as well as the prestigious Nippon Shuji Prize.<br /><br />His novel, In This Living Body, is twinned with his Shingy\u014d: Reflections on Translating the Heart Sutra, both now available on Amazon.<br /><br />With a Masters in Asian Studies, three of his calligraphy workbooks have been published in Japan. His classic book on Japanese swordsmanship, Sword and Psyche, led to WAZA, his first novel about Japanese Buddhism and the martial arts, which received the CoVisions Recognition Award for Literature in 1994.<br /><br />Now primarily a literary author, he still teaches the Zen of swordsmanship and custom brushes calligraphy for clients and collectors from his studio in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.<br />",

In 2005 he tore through the Australian batting order, swinging the ball at pace, and inspiring some of England's greatest ever victories as they regained the Ashes for the first time in almost twenty years. That series he dismissed every single Australian batsman apart from Glenn McGrath, taking 18 wickets at an average of 21. Injury forced him out of the final match at the Oval and prevented him from playing Test cricket again. He subsequently fought for eight years to return to the top level despite a series of further setbacks. Now retired, he lives in Cardiff with his wife Justine and his two young sons.",

Coincidentally, Robert Osborne, who originally illustrated SOME THINGS ARE SCARY in 1969, was a major influence on Jules Feiffer's work. Of his first reading of Florence Parry Heide's text, Jules Feiffer says, \"It reminded me very much of the emotional materials that I drew on for my early cartoons.\" And he adds, \"When I was a child, everything was scary-especially parents!\"<br />",

Hailing from Long Island, Pynchon spent two years in the United States Navy and earned an English degree from Cornell University. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known today: <i>V.</i> (1963), <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> (1966), <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> (1973), <i>Vineland</i> (1990), <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> (1997), and <i>Against the Day</i> (2006).<br /><br />Pynchon is regarded by many readers and critics as one of the finest contemporary authors. He is a MacArthur Fellow and a recipient of the National Book Award, and is regularly cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Both his fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, styles, and themes, including (but not limited to) the fields of history, science and mathematics. Pynchon is also known for his avoidance of personal publicity: very few photographs of him have ever been published, and rumours about his location and identity have been circulated since the 1960's.<br />",

At Cornell University in the late fifties Farina was suspended for his part in a student protest, but was promptly reinstated when fellow students threatened to take further action to support him.<br />Leaving Cornell in 1959, he lived in Paris and London, surviving by 'music, street-singing, scriptwriting, acting, a little smuggling, anything to hang on'. In 1963 he returned to America and married Mimi Baez, sister of Joan, and they became a folk duo. Their debut album was recommended by the <i>New York Times</i> as one of the ten best releases of 1965.<br />Farina was killed in a motorbike accident, just two days after his book <i>Been Down so Long It Looks Like Up to Me</i> had been published.",

After spending time as an actor, teacher, and freelance writer, he has finally returned to his first love, fiction. <i>Dancing on the Inside</i> is his first juvenile novel.<br /><br />Glen C. Strathy earned an M.A. in English from the University of Western Ontario, and graduated from the Artist in Community Education program at Queen's University, Kingston.

His arguably best-known work, The Collapse of Complex Societies (1988), examines the collapse of Maya and Chacoan civilizations,[2] and of the Western Roman Empire, in terms of network theory, energy economics and complexity theory. Tainter argues that sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions[3] and that societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their \"energy subsidies\" reach a point of diminishing marginal returns. He recognizes collapse when a society rapidly sheds a significant portion of its complexity.<br />",

        "biography": "Nikola Tesla was a genius polymath, inventor and a mechanical and electrical engineer. He is frequently cited as one of the most important contributors to the birth of commercial electricity, a man who \"shed light over the face of Earth,\" and is best known for his many revolutionary developments in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tesla's patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current (AC) electric power systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />Born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, Vojna Krajina, in the territory of today's Croatia, he was a subject of the Austrian Empire by birth and later became an American citizen. After his demonstration of wireless communication (radio) in 1894 and after being the victor in the \"War of Currents\", he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in America. Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. During this period, in the United States, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist in history or popular culture, but due to his eccentric personality and his seemingly unbelievable and sometimes bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological developments, Tesla was ultimately ostracized and regarded as a mad scientist. Never having put much focus on his finances, Tesla died impoverished at the age of 86.<br /><br />The SI unit measuring magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic field \"B\"), the tesla, was named in his honor (at the <i>Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures</i>, Paris, 1960), as well as the Tesla effect of wireless energy transfer to wirelessly power electronic devices which Tesla demonstrated on a low scale (lightbulbs) as early as 1893 and aspired to use for the intercontinental transmission of industrial energy levels in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.<br /><br />Aside from his work on electromagnetism and electromechanical engineering, Tesla contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of robotics, remote control, radar and computer science, and to the expansion of ballistics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States credited him as being the inventor of the radio. Many of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and early New Age occultism.<br />",

        "biography": "David Hatcher Childress (born 1957) is an American author and publisher of books on topics in alternative history and historical revisionism. His works often cover such subjects as pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, the Knights Templar, lost cities and vimana aircraft. Despite his public involvement in the general field of study, Childress claims to have no academic credentials as a professional archaeologist.<br /><br />Born in France, and raised in Colorado, Childress began his world travels at age nineteen in pursuit of his archaeological interests. In 1983 Childress relocated to Stelle, Illinois, a community founded by New Age writer Richard Kieninger, after Childress was given a book authored by Kieninger while touring Africa. Childress chronicled his explorations in his Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries series of books, whose core concepts were influenced by the ideas of Kieninger.<br /><br />While residing in Stelle, Childress began self publishing his own works and later other authors, which focus on presenting fringe scientific theories regarding ancient civilizations and little-known technologies, as well as establishing a travel business in partnership with Kieninger. In 1991, in the nearby town of Kempton, Illinois, Childress, along with historian and linguist Carl W. Hart, founded the World Explorers Club, a group that often travels to the places he writes about, and an affiliated magazine, World Explorer.<br /><br />David Hatcher Childress has appeared on several television programs on NBC (\"The Mysterious Origins of Man\"), Fox Network (Sightings and Encounters), Discovery Channel, A&amp;E, The History Channel, as a commentator on subjects such as the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and UFOs.<br /><br />Childress has been involved in two lawsuits regarding his publishing activities, one of which failed due to the expiry of a statute of limitations and the other, involving his company's publication of a master's thesis without permission, which was settled out of court.<br /> from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hatcher_Childress\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ha...</a>",

To date, I've published over thirty novels, one of them a prestigious RITA Award nominee, Romance Writers of America's highest award of excellence. I have also been nominated by Romantic Times magazine for several Reviewer's Choice awards, as well as a career achievement award.<br /><br />I've written for several different publishers, including Harlequin Books, Leisure Books, Berkley/Jove, St. Martin's Press and Warner Books. Born and bred in the Lone Start State, I still live deep in the heart with my real-life hero, Curt, and our young children.<br /><br />Like any over-worked, under-appreciated wife and mother, I have very little free time. But when I find a few precious moments, I LOVE to read. Some of my favorite authors include Janet Evanovich, Vicki Lewis Thompson, Charlaine Harris (see my Favorite Reads page for more) and the exceptionally talented Nina Bangs. Give me a bag of Sugar Babies, a Toby Keith or Kevin Fowler CD (I love Texas music), and a great book, and I'm in heaven!",

Golding spent two years in Oxford focusing on sciences; however, he changed his educational emphasis to English literature, especially Anglo-Saxon.<br /><br />During World War II, he was part of the Royal Navy which he left five years later. His bellic experience strongly influenced his future novels. Later, he became a teacher and focused on writing. Some of his influences are classical Greek literature, such as Euripides, and <i>The Battle of Maldon</i>, an Anglo-Saxon oeuvre whose author is unknown.<br /><br />The attention given to <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, Golding's first novel, by college students in the 1950s and 1960s drove literary critics' attention to it. He was awarded the Booker Prize for literature in 1980 for his novel <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14431.Rites_of_Passage\" title=\"Rites of Passage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rites of Passage</a>, the first book of the trilogy <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/58734-to-the-ends-of-the-earth\" rel=\"nofollow\">To the Ends of the Earth</a>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983 and was knighted in 1988.<br /><br />In 2008, <i>The Times</i> ranked Golding third on their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".",

        "biography": "After 15 years of concentrating exclusively on painting Nick Jolly embarked on a haphazard writing career in tandem with his pursuits as an artist. This initially took the form of articles penned for the Art Review. Then in 1999 he co-founded The Chap magazine, under the alter ego of Vic Darkwood, with his erstwhile colleague Gustav Temple. During this time, as well as producing a quarterly magazine, they also wrote 3 spin-off Chap books.<br /><br />At the end of 2003 Vic Darkwood left The Chap, as he felt that his work on that periodical was done. At the time he cited 'artistic differences' and 'a pronounced fatigue at superimposing yet more pipes onto vintage photographs of gentlemen' as his reasons for leaving, but an urge to dedicate himself more fully to the studio was the real motivation.Despite these best resolve, in 2005 he collaborated once more with Gustav Temple to construct a final Chap tome and then in 2006 wrote his first solo book The Lost Art of Travel (published in the U.S. under the title: How to Make Friends and Oppress People)<br /><br />For the past four yeares Jolly has spent most of his time working on the development of his paintings. An exhibition of these will be held at 108 Fine Art in 2009.",

        "biography": "Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.<br /><br />Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.<br /><br />Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.<br />",

Parker</a>.</i><br /><b>Robert Brown Parker</b> was an American crime writer. His most famous works were the novels about the private detective Spenser. ABC television network developed the television series <i>Spenser: For Hire</i> based on the character in the late 1980s; a series of TV movies based on the character were also produced. His works incorporate encyclopedic knowledge of the Boston metropolitan area. Parker was 77 when he died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts; discovered at his desk by his wife Joan, he had been working on a novel. The Spenser novels have been cited by critics and bestselling authors such as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8944.Robert_Crais\" title=\"Robert Crais\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Crais</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/24689.Harlan_Coben\" title=\"Harlan Coben\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harlan Coben</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10289.Dennis_Lehane\" title=\"Dennis Lehane\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dennis Lehane</a> as not only influencing their own work but reviving and changing the detective genre.<br />Robert B. Parker was one of contemporary fiction's most popular and respected detective writers. Best known for his portrayal of the tough but erudite investigator Spenser, Parker wrote over twenty-five novels over the course of his career, which began in 1973. Parker's acclaim and his thorough background in classic detective literature helped earn him the somewhat unusual commission of completing a Philip Marlowe novel that the great Raymond Chandler had left unfinished. <br /><br />Promised Land and the other Spenser novels spawned the movie Spenser: For Hire and a string of made-for-TV movies.",

Years ago, I was thinking about Virginia Woolf\u2019s question: what if Shakespeare had had an equally talented sister? <br />Woolf\u2019s answer: She died without writing a word.<br />What, I wondered, would it take for a woman of that era, with that kind of capacious intelligence, not to die without writing a word?<br />For one thing, she\u2019d have to be a genius at breaking rules.<br />My novel The Weight of Ink reaches back in time to ask the question: what does it take for a woman not to be defeated when everything around her is telling her to sit down and mind her manners? I started writing with two characters in mind, both women who don\u2019t mind their manners: a contemporary historian named Helen Watt and a seventeenth century Inquisition refugee named Ester Velasquez. It\u2019s been a delight working on their story. <br />The Weight of Ink is my third novel, but I\u2019ve also written two other novels and one novella, plus a few dozen essays and stories. Whether I\u2019m writing fiction or nonfiction, I put words to paper because it's my way of metabolizing life. To paraphrase Henry James: I don't really know what I think until I see what I say. <br />Thanks for visiting this page, and for your interest in books.<br />",

When the Bolsheviks requisitioned the pharmacy owned by her father, Fronz, the Rosenbaums fled to the Crimea. Alisa returned to the city (renamed Leningrad) to attend the university, but in 1926 relatives who had already settled in America offered her the chance of joining them there. With money from the sale of her mother's jewelry, Alisa bought a ticket to New York. On arrival at Ellis Island, she changed into Ayn (after a name of some Finnish author, probably \"Aino\") Rand (which she said was an abbreviation of her Russian surname). She moved swiftly to Hollywood, where she learned English, worked in the RKO wardrobe department and as an extra, and wrote through the night on screenplays and novels. She also married a bit-part actor called Frank O'Connor because he was 'beautiful' - and because her original visitor's visa had run out.<br />Rand sold her first screenplay in 1932, but nobody would buy her first novel <i>We the Living</i> (1936) a melodrama set in Russia. Her first real success was <i>The Fountainhead</i> (rejected by more than ten publishers before publication in 1943).<br />She started a new philosophy known as Objectivism, opposed to state interference of all kinds, and her follow-up novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) describes a group who attempt to escape America's conspiracy of mediocrity. Objectivism has been an influence on various other movements such as Libertarianism, and Rand's vocal support for Laissez-faire Capitalism and the free market has earned her a distinct spot among American philosophers, and philosophers in general.<br /><br />---<br />",

        "biography": "Alan Greenspan is an American economist and from 1987 to 2006 chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve of the United States. He currently works as a private advisor, making speeches and providing consulting for firms through his company, Greenspan Associates LLC.<br /><br />First appointed Fed chairman by President Ronald Reagan in August 1987, he was reappointed at successive four-year intervals until retiring after a record-setting tenure on January 31, 2006, at which time he relinquished the chairmanship to Ben Bernanke. Greenspan was lauded for his handling of the Black Monday stock market crash that occurred very shortly after he first became chairman, as well as for his stewardship of the Internet-driven, \"dot-com\" economic boom of the 1990s.[citation needed] This expansion culminated in a stock market bubble burst in March 2000 followed by a recession beginning in late 2000 and continuing through 2002.<br /><br />From 2001 until his retirement from the Fed, he was increasingly criticized for some statements seen as overstepping the Fed's traditional purview of monetary policy, and viewed by others as overly supportive of the policies of President George W. Bush, as well as for policies seen by Business Week Magazine and others as leading to a housing bubble. During his tenure Greenspan was considered to be the leading authority on American domestic economic and monetary policy, and his active influence continues to this day.<br />",

Although his existence remains uncertain and (if they ever existed) no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.<br /><br />Scattered details of Aesop's life can be found in ancient sources, including <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2192.Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aristotle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/901.Herodotus\" title=\"Herodotus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herodotus</a>, and Plutarch. An ancient literary work called The Aesop Romance tells an episodic, probably highly fictional version of his life, including the traditional description of him as a strikingly ugly slave (\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) who by his cleverness acquires freedom and becomes an adviser to kings and city-states. Older spellings of his name have included Esop(e) and Isope. A later tradition (dating from the Middle Ages) depicts Aesop as a black Ethiopian. Depictions of Aesop in popular culture over the last 2500 years have included several works of art and his appearance as a character in numerous books, films, plays, and television programs.<br /><br />Abandoning the perennial image of Aesop as an ugly slave, the movie Night in Paradise (1946) cast Turhan Bey in the role, depicting Aesop as an advisor to King Croesus who falls in love with the king's intended bride, a Persian princess played by Merle Oberon. There was also the 1953 teleplay Aesop and Rhodope by Helene Hanff, broadcast on Hallmark Hall of Fame with Lamont Johnson playing Aesop.<br /><br />A raposa e as uvas (\"The Fox and the Grapes\"), a play in three acts about the life of Aesop by Brazilian dramatist Guilherme Figueiredo, was published in 1953 and has been performed in many countries, including a videotaped production in China in 2000 under the title Hu li yu pu tao or \u72d0\u72f8\u4e0e\u8461\u8404.<br /><br />Beginning in 1959, animated shorts under the title Aesop and Son appeared as a recurring segment in the TV series Rocky and His Friends and its successor, The Bullwinkle Show. The image of Aesop as ugly slave was abandoned; Aesop (voiced by Charles Ruggles), a Greek citizen, would recount a fable for the edification of his son, Aesop Jr., who would then deliver the moral in the form of an atrocious pun. Aesop's 1998 appearance in the episode \"Hercules and the Kids\" in the animated TV series Hercules (voiced by Robert Keeshan) amounted to little more than a cameo.<br /><br />In 1971, Bill Cosby played Aesop in the TV production Aesop's Fables.<br /><br />The musical Aesop's Fables by British playwright Peter Terson was first produced in 1983. In 2010, the play was staged at the Fugard Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa with Mhlekahi Mosiea as Aesop.",

He was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud in the early 1990s, and in 1998 he was sued by U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for making false or misleading claims in infomercials promoting his book The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About. In 2004, he settled that action, by agreeing to pay a $500,000 fine and consenting to a lifetime ban on promoting products other than his books via infomercials. On Nov. 29, 2011, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a $37.6 million fine levied against him for violating that 2004 settlement. Additionally, on remand, the district court modified its final order, requiring that he post a $2 million bond before engaging in future infomercial advertising.<br /><br />On March 17, 2014, Trudeau was sentenced to 10 years in prison stemming from his November 2013 criminal contempt conviction.<br /><br />(Wikipedia)",

        "biography": "Alexis-Charles-Henri Cl\u00e9rel de Tocqueville (July 29, 1805 \u2013 April 16, 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these works, he explored the effects of the rising equality of social conditions on the individual and the state in western societies.<br /><br />Democracy in America (1835), his major work, published after his travels in the United States, is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. An eminent representative of the classical liberal political tradition, Tocqueville was an active participant in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848) and then during the Second Republic (1849\u20131851) which succeeded to the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's December 2, 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution, Volume I. After obtaining a law degree, Alexis de Tocqueville was named auditor-magistrate at the court of Versailles. There, he met Gustave de Beaumont, a prosecutor substitute, who collaborated with him on various literary works. Both were sent to the United States to study the penitentiary system. During this trip, they wrote Du syst\u00e8me p\u00e9nitentiaire aux Etats-Unis et de son application (1832). Back in France, Tocqueville became a lawyer. He met the English economist Nassau William Senior in 1833, and they became good friends and corresponded for many years.[1] He published his master-work, De la d\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique, in 1835. The success of this work, an early model for the science that would become known as sociology, led him to be named chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) in 1837, and to be elected the next year to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques. In 1841 he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.<br /><br />Tocqueville, who despised the July Monarchy (1830\u20131848), began his political career in the same period. Thus, he became deputy of the Manche department (Valognes), a position which he maintained until 1851. In parliament, he defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade, while supporting the colonization of Algeria carried on by Louis-Philippe's regime. Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of the Manche in 1842, and became the president of the department's conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral between 1849 and 1851.<br /><br />Apart from Canada, Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England, producing Memoir on Pauperism. In 1841 and 1846, he traveled to Algeria. His first travel inspired his Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, in which he criticized the French model of colonization, based on an assimilationist view, preferring instead the British model of indirect rule, which did not mix different populations together. He went as far as openly advocating racial segregation between the European colonists and the \"Arabs\" through the implementation of two different legislative systems (a half century before its effective implementation with the 1881 Indigenous code).<br /><br />After the fall of the July Monarchy during the February 1848 Revolution, Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, where he became a member of the Commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the Second Republic (1848\u20131851). He defended bicameralism (two parliamentary chambers) and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the laboring population of Paris, universal suffrage was conceived as a means to block the revolutionary spirit of Paris.<br /><br />During the Second Republic, Tocqueville sided with the parti de l'Ordre against the \"socialists\" and workers.

He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6648.Paul_Dinello\" title=\"Paul Dinello\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paul Dinello</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2848.Amy_Sedaris\" title=\"Amy Sedaris\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amy Sedaris</a>, with whom he developed the critically-acclaimed sketch comedy series <i>Exit 57</i>.<br />Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived <i>Dana Carvey Show</i> before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series <i>Strangers with Candy</i>. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted, gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. It was his work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series <i>The Daily Show</i>, however, that first introduced him to a wide audience.<br />In 2005, he left <i>The Daily Show</i> to host a spin-off series, <i>The Colbert Report</i>. Following The Daily Show's news-parody concept, The Colbert Report styles itself as a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as Bill O'Reilly's <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>. Since its debut, the series has been successful, establishing itself as one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert three Emmy nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006. Colbert was named one of <i>Time</i>'s 100 most influential people in 2006.

He went on to host his own show on MTV, called <i>The Jon Stewart Show</i>, and then hosted another show on MTV called You Wrote It, You Watch It.<br /><br />Stewart became the host of <i>The Daily Show</i> on Comedy Central in early 1999. He is also a writer and co-producer of the show. After Stewart joined, <i>The Daily Show</i> steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim leading to his first Emmy Award in 2001. Stewart himself has also gained significant notoriety as a vocal, outspoken critic of the Bush administration and of personality-driven media shows, in particular Bill O'Reilly and the Fox News Channel. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his \"mock news\" desk. However the validity of this distinction is challenged by a number of critics, researchers, and even supporters, some of whom have awarded <i>The Daily Show</i> with news and journalism awards.<br /><br />Stewart co-wrote <i>America (The Book)</i>, which was one of the top fifteen best-sellers in the US in 2004. Stewart hosted the 78th Academy Awards and the 80th Academy Awards.",

Hsing Yun is a forty-eighth generation lineage holder of the Linji Chan (Rinzai Zen) school through Master Zhi Kai, his teacher. He served as the first, second and third term director and abbot of the order before voluntarily resigning his position in 1985 in favor of his disciple, Hsin Ping.<br /><br />Hsing Yun is known for his \"Humanistic Buddhism\" philosophy employed by the Fo Guang Shan order, which utilizes Buddhism to fit the needs of a modern world. He is credited by Buddhist scholars as one of the forefront leaders in modern reformation of Buddhism by opening monasteries, universities and schools around the world, as well as engaging in religious dialogue amongst other Buddhist sects and religious faiths.<br /><br />In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is notable for his activity in political affairs, particularly on the One China Policy as well as government legislation supported by the Kuomintang, and is often criticized for his views by those in favor of Taiwanese independence, conservative Buddhists and religious figures. He was a figure of interest during the 1996 United States finance scandal involving then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore and a visit to Hsi Lai Temple, the U.S. branch of Hsing Yun's organization",

Her mother was a very religious woman and taught her the rudiments of Buddhist practice, such as nightly chants and the observance of the precepts, from an early age. In later life she described how, at the age of six, she became so filled with fear and loathing at the miseries her mother went through in being pregnant and giving birth to a younger sibling that, on seeing the newborn child for the first time \u2014 \"sleeping quietly, a little red thing with black, black hair\" \u2014 she ran away from home for three days. This experience, plus the anguish she must have felt when her parents separated, probably lay behind her decision, made when she was still quite young, never to submit to what she saw as the slavery of marriage.<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/kee/dynamic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/th...</a><br /><br />",

        "biography": "Steve McCurry, recognized universally as one of today\u2019s finest image-makers, has won many of photography\u2019s top awards. Best known for his evocative color photography, McCurry, in the finest documentary tradition, captures the essence of human struggle and joy. Member of Magnum Photos since 1986, McCurry has searched and found the unforgettable; many of his images have become modern icons. Born in Philadelphia, McCurry graduated cum laude from the College of Arts and Architecture at the Pennsylvania State University. After working at a newspaper for two years, he left for India to freelance. It was in India that McCurry learned to watch and wait on life. \u201cIf you wait,\u201d he realized, \u201cpeople will forget your camera and the soul will drift up into view.\u201d<br /><br />His career was launched when, disguised in native garb, he crossed the Pakistan border into rebel-controlled Afghanistan just before the Russian invasion. When he emerged, he had rolls of film sewn into his clothes of images that would be published around the world as among the first to show the conflict there. His coverage won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad, an award dedicated to photographers exhibiting exceptional courage and enterprise. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including Magazine Photographer of the Year, awarded by the National Press Photographers\u2019 Association. That was the same year in which he won an unprecedented four first prizes in the World Press Photo Contest. He has won the Olivier Rebbot Memorial Award twice.<br /><br />Steve McCurry has covered many areas of international and civil conflict, including the Iran-Iraq war, the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, Beirut, Cambodia, the Philippines, the Gulf War, and continuing coverage of Afghanistan. He focuses on the human consequences of war, not only showing what war impresses on the landscape, but rather, on the human face. <br /><br />McCurry\u2019s work has been featured in every major magazine in the world and frequently appears in National Geographic magazine with recent articles on the Hazaras of Afghanistan, Buddhism, Tibet, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and the temples of Angkor Wat, Cambodia. McCurry is driven by an innate curiosity and sense of wonder about the world and everyone in it. He has an uncanny ability to cross boundaries of language and culture to capture stories of human experience. \u201cMost of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape that you could call the human condition.\u201d <br /><br />A high point in his career was the rediscovery of the previously unidentified Afghan refugee girl that many have described as the most recognizable photograph in the world today. When McCurry finally located Sharbat Gula after almost two decades, he said, \u201cHer skin is weathered; there are wrinkles now, but she is a striking as she was all those years ago.\u201d McCurry returned from an extended assignment in China on September 10, 2001. His coverage at Ground Zero on September 11 is a testament to the heroism and nobility of the people of New York City. \u201cYou felt the horror and immediately, instinctively understood that our lives would never be the same again.\u201d<br /><br />McCurry has published many books including, In the Shadows of Mountains (2007), Looking East (2006), Steve McCurry (2005), The Path to Buddha: A Tibetan Pilgrimage (2003), Sanctuary (2002), South Southeast (2000), Portraits (1999), Monsoon (1988), The Imperial Way (1985).<br />",

        "biography": "Charlotte Joko Beck was an American Zen teacher. Born in New Jersey, she studied music at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and worked for some time as a pianist and piano teacher. She married and raised a family of four children, then separated from her husband and worked as a teacher, secretary, and assistant in a university department. She began Zen practice in her 40s with Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi in Los Angeles, and later with Hakuun Yasutani and Soen Nakagawa. Having received Dharma transmission from Taizan Maezumi Roshi, she opened the Zen Center San Diego in 1983, serving as its head teacher until July 2006.<br />Beck was responsible for a number of important innovations in Zen teaching. In particular, she taught students to work with the emotions of everyday life rather than attempting to avoid or escape them. Because she was adept at teaching students to work with their psychological states, she attracted a number of students who were interested in the relationship between Zen and modern psychology. Several of her Dharma heirs are practicing psychologists/psychiatrists. In 1995 Joko, along with three of her Dharma heirs, founded the Ordinary Mind Zen School.<br />Shortly after Beck\u2019s departure in 2006, she revoked Dharma transmission from two senior students: Ezra Bayda and Elizabeth Hamilton. Beck also stated that Zen Center San Diego should not claim to represent her or her teaching. In 2006 Joko moved to Prescott, Arizona, where she continued to teach until she retired as a teacher in late 2010. In the spring of 2010, Joko announced Gary Nafstad as her last Dharma successor",

        "biography": "<b>Mary Shelley</b> (n\u00e9e Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, often known as <i>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</i>) was a British novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, travel writer, and editor of the works of her husband, Romantic poet and philosopher <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45882\" rel=\"nofollow\">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. She was the daughter of the political philosopher <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/113910\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Godwin</a> and the writer, philosopher, and feminist <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1853305\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>.<br /><br />Mary Shelley was taken seriously as a writer in her own lifetime, though reviewers often missed the political edge to her novels. After her death, however, she was chiefly remembered only as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley and as the author of <i>Frankenstein</i>. It was not until 1989, when Emily Sunstein published her prizewinning biography <i>Mary Shelley: Romance and Reality</i>, that a full-length scholarly biography analyzing all of Shelley's letters, journals, and works within their historical context was published.<br /><br />The well-meaning attempts of Mary Shelley's son and daughter-in-law to \"Victorianise\" her memory through the censoring of letters and biographical material contributed to a perception of Mary Shelley as a more conventional, less reformist figure than her works suggest. Her own timid omissions from Percy Shelley's works and her quiet avoidance of public controversy in the later years of her life added to this impression. <br /><br />The eclipse of Mary Shelley's reputation as a novelist and biographer meant that, until the last thirty years, most of her works remained out of print, obstructing a larger view of her achievement. She was seen as a one-novel author, if that. In recent decades, however, the republication of almost all her writings has stimulated a new recognition of its value. Her voracious reading habits and intensive study, revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works, is now better appreciated. Shelley's recognition of herself as an author has also been recognized; after Percy's death, she wrote about her authorial ambitions: \"I think that I can maintain myself, and there is something inspiriting in the idea\". Scholars now consider Mary Shelley to be a major Romantic figure, significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal.",

In March 1998, while reading the apostolic fathers and subsequent church history in preparation for a Wednesday evening bible study, Alex Jones discovered the Catholic Church to be charismatic/liturgical, hierarchical, and Eucharistic-centered. In light of that revelation, Alex and his wife Donna began a two year journey into the Catholic Church that culminated in fifty-four members of his previous congregation, including fourteen members of his own family, entering the Catholic Church. The group began R.C.I.A. at St. Suzanne Catholic Community on September 10, 2000 and were welcomed into the Catholic Church through confirmation during Easter Vigil on April 14, 2001. Alex Jones was subsequently ordained a Permanent Deacon in the Archdiocese of Detroit on October 1, 2005. Deacon Jones received his Masters in Pastoral Studies from Sacred Heart Major Seminary on April 28, 2007 and retired from the position of evangelization coordinator for the Archdiocese of Detroit on May 31, 2007. Deacon Jones currently serves the three parishes of St. Suzanne/OLGH, St. Mary of Redford, and St. Thomas Aquinas. He and his wife Donna have three sons and ten grandchildren.",

        "biography": "The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO was born in 1947 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Before dedicating his life completely to literature, he worked as theatre director and actor, lyricist and journalist. In 1986, PAULO COELHO did the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella, an experience later to be documented in his book The Pilgrimage. In the following year, COELHO published The Alchemist. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time. Other titles include Brida (1990), The Valkyries (1992), By the river Piedra I sat Down and Wept (1994), the collection of his best columns published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo entitle Maktub (1994), the compilation of texts Phrases (1995), The Fifth Mountain (1996), Manual of a Warrior of Light (1997), Veronika decides to die (1998), The Devil and Miss Prym (2000), the compilation of traditional tales in Stories for parents, children and grandchildren (2001), Eleven Minutes (2003), The Zahir (2005), The Witch of Portobello (2006) and Winner Stands Alone (to be released in 2009). During the months of March, April, May and June 2006, Paulo Coelho traveled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella in 1986. He also held surprise book signings - announced one day in advance - in some cities along the way, to have a chance to meet his readers. In ninety days of pilgrimage the author traveled around the globe and took the famous Transiberrian train that took him to Vladivostok. During this experience Paulo Coelho launched his blog Walking the Path - The Pilgrimage in order to share with his readers his impressions. Since this first blog Paulo Coelho has expanded his presence in the internet with his daily blogs in Wordpress, Myspace &amp; Facebook. He is equally present in media sharing sites such as Youtube and Flickr, offering on a regular basis not only texts but also videos and pictures to his readers. From this intensive interest and use of the Internet sprang his bold new project: The Experimental Witch where he invites his readers to adapt to the screen his book The Witch of Portobello. Indeed Paulo Coelho is a firm believer of Internet as a new media and is the first Best-selling author to actively support online free distribution of his work.",

        "biography": "John Steinbeck III was an American writer. He wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and the novella Of Mice and Men, published in 1937. In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. <br /><br />In 1962 Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck grew up in the Salinas Valley region of California, a culturally diverse place of rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place. <br /><br />Steinbeck moved briefly to New York City, but soon returned home to California to begin his career as a writer. Most of his earlier work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel Cup of Gold which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.<br /><br />In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. Later he used real historical conditions and events in the first half of 20th century America, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. <br /><br />Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. His later body of work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history, and mythology. <br /><br />One of his last published works was Travels with Charley, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America. He died in 1968 in New York of a heart attack and his ashes are interred in Salinas.<br /><br />Seventeen of his works, including The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Cannery Row (1945), The Pearl (1947), and East of Eden (1952), went on to become Hollywood films, and Steinbeck also achieved success as a Hollywood writer, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Story in 1944 for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat.",

        "biography": "W. Timothy Gallwey (born 1938 in San Francisco, California) is an author who has written a series of books in which he has set forth a new methodology for coaching and for the development of personal and professional excellence in a variety of fields, that he calls \"The Inner Game.\" Since he began writing in the 1970s, his books include The Inner Game of Tennis, The Inner Game of Golf, The Inner game of Music (with Barry Green), Inner Skiing and The Inner Game of Work. Gallwey's seminal work is the The Inner Game of Tennis, with more than one million copies in print.[1] Besides sports, his training methods have been applied to the fields of business, health, and education.[1]<br /><br />In 1960, Gallwey was captain of the Harvard University Tennis Team. In the 1970s he learned the meditation techniques of the Divine Light Mission's Guru Maharaj Ji, which Gallwey said enhanced his powers of concentration in a manner that improved his game.[2] In a 1973 New York Times article he described his discovery of Maharaj Ji and his decision to live in an ashram and practice celibacy.[3] In 1997, Gallwey dedicated his book, The Inner Game of Tennis, to him.[4]<br /><br />The \"inner game\" is based upon certain principles in which an individual uses non-judgmental observations of critical variables, with the purpose of being accurate about these observations. If the observations are accurate, the person's body will adjust and correct automatically to achieve best performance.[5] Gallwey was one of the first to demonstrate a comprehensive method of coaching that could be applied to many situations, and found himself lecturing more often to business leaders in the U.S. than to sports people.[6]<br /><br />Tim Gallwey's work went on to found the current movement in business coaching, life coaching and executive coaching. One of the most well known exponents of business coaching is Sir John Whitmore, who popularised Graham Alexander's and Alan Fine's \"GROW\" model of the coaching process.[6]<br /><br /> In every human endeavor there are two arenas of engagement: the outer and the inner. The outer game is played on an external arena to overcome external obstacles to reach an external goal. The inner game takes place within the mind of the player and is played against such obstacles as fear, self-doubt, lapses in focus, and limiting concepts or assumptions. The inner game is played to overcome the self-imposed obstacles that prevent an individual or team from accessing their full potential.",

Andrews name</b><br /><br />Virginia Cleo Andrews (born Cleo Virginia Andrews) was born June 6, 1923 in Portsmouth, Virginia. The youngest child and the only daughter of William Henry Andrews, a career navy man who opened a tool-and-die business after retirement, and Lillian Lilnora Parker Andrews, a telephone operator. She spent her happy childhood years in Portsmouth, Virginia, living briefly in Rochester, New York. The Andrews family returned to Portsmouth while Virginia was in high school.<br /><br />While a teenager, Virginia suffered a tragic accident, falling down the stairs at her school and incurred severe back injuries. Arthritis and a failed spinal surgical procedure forced her to spend most of her life on crutches or in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Virginia excelled in school and, at fifteen, won a scholarship for writing a parody of Tennyson's <i>Idylls of the King</i>. She proudly earned her diploma from Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth. After graduation, she nurtured her artistic talent by completing a four-year correspondence art course while living at home with her family.<br /><br />After William Andrews died in the late 1960s, Virginia helped to support herself and her mother through her extremely successful career as a commercial artist, portrait painter, and fashion illustrator.<br /><br />Frustrated with the lack of creative satisfaction that her work provided, Virginia sought creative release through writing, which she did in secret. In 1972, she completed her first novel, <i>The Gods of the Green Mountain</i> [sic], a science-fantasy story. It was never published. Between 1972 and 1979, she wrote nine novels and twenty short stories, of which only one was published. \"I Slept with My Uncle on My Wedding Night\", a short fiction piece, was published in a pulp confession magazine.<br /><br />Promise gleamed over the horizon for Virginia when she submitted a 290,000-word novel, <i>The Obsessed</i>, to a publishing company. She was told that the story had potential, but needed to be trimmed and spiced up a bit. She drafted a new outline in a single night and added \"unspeakable things my mother didn't want me to write about.\" The ninety-eight-page revision was re-titled <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> and she was paid a $7,500 advance. Her new-generation Gothic novel reached the bestseller lists a mere two weeks after its 1979 paperback publication by Pocket Books.<br /><br /><i>Petals on the Wind</i>, her sequel to <i>Flowers</i>, was published the next year, earning Virginia a $35,000 advance. The second book remained on the New York Times bestseller list for an unbelievable nineteen weeks (<i>Flowers</i> also returned to the list). These first two novels alone sold over seven million copies in only two years. The third novel of the Dollanganger series, <i>If There Be Thorns</i>, was released in 1981, bringing Virginia a $75,000 advance. It reached No. 2 on many bestseller lists within its first two weeks.<br /><br />Taking a break from the chronicles of Chris and Cathy Dollanganger, Virginia published her one, and only, stand-alone novel, <i>My Sweet Audrina</i>, in 1982. The book welcomed an immediate success, topping the sales figures of her previous novels. Two years later, a fourth Dollanganger novel was released, <i>Seeds of Yesterday</i>. According to the New York Times, <i>Seeds</i> was the best-selling fiction paperback novel of 1984. Also in 1984, V.C. Andrews was named \"Professional Woman of the Year\" by the city of Norfolk, Virginia.<br /><br />Upon Andrews's death in 1986, two final novels\u2014<i>Garden of Shadows</i> and <i>Fallen Hearts</i>\u2014were published. These two novels are considered the last to bear the \"V.C. Andrews\" name and to be almost completely written by",

She had written all through her infant and junior years and on into her teens, the stories changing from children's adventures to torrid gypsy passions. Her mother used to gather these up from time to time, when her bedroom became too untidy, and dispose of them!<br /><br />Mildred has always wanted to write - which is not to say she has always wanted to be a professional writer. One the contrary, for years She wrote only for her own pleasure, and it wasn't until her husband suggested that she ought to send one of her stories to a publisher that they put several publishers names into a hat and pulled one out. The trouble was, she never used to finish any of the stories, and Caroline, her first published book as Anne Mather, was the first book she'd actually completed. She was newly married then, and her daughter was just a baby, and it was quite a job juggling her household chores and scribbling away in exercise books every chance she got. Not very professional, as you can see, but that's the way it was. The rest as they say in history. And now, more than 160 books later, she's literally - excuse the pun - staggered by what happened. She also published books as Caroline Fleming or Cardine Fleming. Her Anne Mather's novel, Leopard in the Snow, was developed into a 1978 movie.<br /><br />Mildred now has two grown-up children, a son and daughter, and two adorable grandchildren, Abigail and Ben.",

He is widely considered to be one of the great writers on success. His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich (1937), is one of the best-selling books of all time (at the time of Hill's death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold 20 million copies). Hill's works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. He became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1936. \"What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve\" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions. How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach of the average person, were the focal points of Hill's books.",

        "biography": "Riki Wilchins is an activist whose work has focused on the impact of gender norms. While she started out as a transgender leader -- founding the first national transgender advocacy group (GenderPAC) -- her analysis and work broadened over time to include discrimination and violence regardless of individuals' identity. While this perspective has been widely accepted, its breadth has provoked criticism by some in the transgender community. Wilchins' work and writing has often focused on youth, whom she not only sees as uniquely vulnerable to the gender system's pressures and harm, but whom she sees as capable of \"looking with fresh eyes.\" Wilchins' work has been instrumental in bringing transgender rights into the mainstream LGBT movmement, and has helped bring awareness of the impact of gender norms to a wider audience. In 2001, Wilchins' work resulted in her being selected one of just six community activists named by TIME Magazine among its \"100 Civic Innovators for the 21st Century.\" <br /><br />A founding member of Camp Trans, since the mid-1990s Wilchins has been highly active in founding a number of organizations and events focused on gender issues, including:<br /><br />The Transexual Menace, the first large direct action group for transgender rights, which was modeled along the lines of Queer Nation and which at one point boasted representatives in 40+ cities (co-founder Denise Norris).<br />Hermaphrodites With Attitude, the first direct action group for the intersex (co-founder Cheryl Chase, Executive Director of the ISNA, the Intersex Society of North America).<br />NYC Gay Community Center Gender Identity Project (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).<br />NYC Gay Community Center Transgender Health Empowerment Conference, an annual event (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).<br />Camp Trans, an annual educational event outside the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival that contests the exclusion of anyone who is not deemed a \"womyn-born womyn\" (co-founders Janice Walworth, Nancy Jean Burkholder).<br />National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (co-founder Susan Wright, its first Exec. Dir.)<br />National Gender Lobby Day, an annual event on Capitol Hill (co-founder Phyllis Frye).<br /><br />In 1995 Wilchins founded the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition GenderPAC, a tax-exempt organization focused on gender rights issues. GenderPAC originally focused on the transgender community, but gradually broadened its focus to include anyone who suffered discrimination or violence because of their gender identity or gender expression. GenderPAC described its mission as the creation of \"classrooms, communities, and workplaces [that] are safe for everyone to learn, grow, and succeed - whether or not they meet expectations for masculinity and femininity.\" <br /><br />In late 1999, the organization was incorporated and received tax-exempt status. In 2009 it rebranded and relaunched as a new organization, effectively ceasing operations as GenderPAC. While GenderPAC's Executive Director, Wilchins helped dozens of corporations as diverse as IBM, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, as well as major funders like the Arcus and Gill Foundations to expand their employment non-discrimination policies to include gender identity and gender expression. GenderPAC's Congressional Non-Discrimination Pledge eventually had almost 200 sponsors, including both Republicans and US Senators. She helped compile and publish the GENIUS (Gender Equality National Index for Universities &amp; Schools) Index, which rated and ranked schools' adoption of gender identity protections. During her watch, GenderPAC also launched the GenderYOUTH Network, which eventually supported student groups at 100+ schools in creating safer and friendlier environments for those who were gender non-conforming on their own campuses.<br /><br />With help from researcher Emilia Lombardi, GenderPAC compiled and published the \"1st National Survey of TransViolence,\" based on surveys provided by more than 500.",

        "biography": "<i>Librarian Note: There is more than one author by this name in the Goodreads database.</i><br /><br />Barbara Brenner is a respected, award-winning author, specializing in works of both juvenile fiction and nonfiction educational material that deals with animals, nature, and ecology. Her interests range from the natural world (i.e. Thinking about Ants) to American history (e.g. Wagon Wheels), all of which are reflected in the wide scope of her work. Brenner discussed with Contemporary Authors Online her influences and how they have affected her literary career, concluding that \u201call the circumstances of my life conspired to make me a writer--just lucky, I guess.\u201d<br /><br />Brenner was born Barbara Lawrence on June 26, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, to Robert Lawrence (a real estate broker) and Marguerite (Furboter) Johnes. Tragically, her mother died when Brenner was just a year old, and, according to Brenner, this has been a large influence on her career, with Contemporary Authors Online showing how this has added a certain level of \u201csensitivity\u201d to her work. She also defines Brooklyn as a place which gave much \u201ccolor\u201d to her work, and where her father\u2019s ambitions for her helped to develop Brenner\u2019s intellectual curiosity.<br /><br />Brenner attended Seton Hall College (now University) and Rutgers University from 1942-46, whilst also working as a copy editor at Prudential Insurance Co. from 1942 \u2013 46. Her freelance work as an artist\u2019s agent prepared her for a literary life, as after the birth of her two children she began work on her first book Somebody\u2019s Slippers, Somebody\u2019s Shoes, published in 1957. She followed this book with an educational picture book entitled Barto Takes the Subway, designed to improve reading comprehension and sight vocabulary<br /><br />Her artistic development continued when she began to collaborate with her husband, illustrator Fred Brenner, on The Flying Patchwork Quilt. Her next book, On the Frontier with Mr. Audubon, was selected by School Library Journal as \u201cThe Best of the Best\u201d among children\u2019s books published over 26 seasons. In a review of On the Frontier with Mr. Audubon, Paul Showers wrote in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cBrenner again demonstrates her gift for invention and respect for facts . . . [it is] written in the polite but colloquial language of the frontier sketching in Audubon\u2019s biographical background and recording events of the journey as they might have been observed by a serious, very perceptive 13- year-old.\u201d One of her best-selling titles was Wagon Wheels (published in 1978), which deals with the trials and tribulations of a close-knit African American family. This true to life story is \u201cexciting and realistic\u201d according to Gisela Jernigan (writing in the children literature journal Booklist), and was named a 1978 American Library Association Notable Book.<br /><br />Throughout the \u201880s and \u201890s Brenner continued to publish, many of her works being influenced by the careers and interests of her sons. Speaking to Contemporary Authors Online Brenner explains that as their sons are both grown, and their respective careers as a \u201cbiologist . . . and musician\u201d have both had an influence on her writing (i.e. Dinosaurium 1993). In 1986, Brenner was honored with the Pennsylvania School Librarians\u2019 Association\u2019s Outstanding Pennsylvania Author Award.

In nine short chapters, Lappe leaves readers feeling liberated and courageous. She flouts conventional right-versus-left divisions and affirms readers' basic sanity - their intuitive knowledge that it is possible to stop grasping at straws and grasp the real roots of today's crises, from hunger and poverty to climate change and terrorism. Because we are creatures of the mind, says Lappe, it is the power of \"frame\"--our core assumptions about how the world works--that determines outcomes. She pinpoints the dominant failing frame now driving out planet toward disaster. By interweaving fresh insights, startling facts, and stirring vignettes of ordinary people pursuing creative solutions to our most pressing global problems, Lappe uncovers a new, empowering \"frame\" through which real solutions are emerging worldwide.\"<br />Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9 is married to Dr. Marc Lapp\u00e9 a former experimental pathologist interested in the problem of environmental contamination.",

        "biography": "\"Long before his name became synonymous with the modern legal thriller, he was working 60-70 hours a week at a small Southaven, Mississippi law practice, squeezing in time before going to the office and during courtroom recesses to work on his hobby\u2014writing his first novel.<br /><br />Born on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to a construction worker and a homemaker, John Grisham as a child dreamed of being a professional baseball player. Realizing he didn't have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990.<br /><br />One day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl's father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988.<br /><br />That might have put an end to Grisham's hobby. However, he had already begun his next book, and it would quickly turn that hobby into a new full-time career\u2014and spark one of publishing's greatest success stories. The day after Grisham completed A Time to Kill, he began work on another novel, the story of a hotshot young attorney lured to an apparently perfect law firm that was not what it appeared. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.<br /><br />The successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham's reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham's success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller.<br /><br />Since first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, and The Broker) and all of them have become international bestsellers. There are currently over 225 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, which have been translated into 29 languages. Nine of his novels have been turned into films (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, A Painted House, The Runaway Jury, and Skipping Christmas), as was an original screenplay, The Gingerbread Man. The Innocent Man (October 2006) marks his first foray into non-fiction.<br /><br />Grisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea. The family splits their time between their Victorian home on a farm in Mississippi and a plantation near Charlottesville, VA.<br /><br />Grisham took time off from writing for several months in 1996 to return, after a five-year hiatus, to the courtroom. He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer: representing the family of a railroad brakeman killed when he was pinned between two cars. Preparing his case with the same passion and dedication as his books' protagonists, Grisham successfully argued his clients' case, earning them a jur",

In addition to writing, I\u2019ve also had a career in finance with specialties including merger &amp; acquisition advisory and private equity at firms like J.P. Morgan in New York City and Winston Partners just outside D.C. in northern Virginia. <br /><br />So, it seemed natural to write about those two worlds and, fortunately, the publishing industry agreed. My first book was published in 1995, The Takeover; about a secret group of men who were trying to destroy the U.S. monetary system by engineering a massive corporate takeover. I have followed The Takeover with 13 more novels all set in high-level finance and national politics.<br /><br />Recently, I decided to alter the theme. The novels will still have a financial focus, but Wall Street won\u2019t be the backdrop. We\u2019ll get out into the world more. And there will be a man versus nature element for the hero in every novel. Hell\u2019s Gate, available August 2009, is set in Montana and involves forest fires and why many of them start. <br /><br />I live in southwest Florida with my wife, Diana, and we have since 2004 after moving down here from northern Virginia. Given the new direction of my books, it seems like a hurricane ought to make an appearance in a novel sometime soon.",

Through the eyes of Hank the Cowdog, a smelly, smart-aleck Head of Ranch Security, Erickson gives readers a glimpse of daily life on a ranch in the West Texas Panhandle. This series of books and tapes is in school libraries across the country, has sold more than 7.6 million copies, is a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and is the winner of the 1993 Audie for Outstanding Children's Series from the Audio Publisher's Association. Publishers Weekly calls Hank a \"grassroots publishing phenomena,\" and USA Today says this is \"the best family entertainment in years.\"<br /><br />Hank the Cowdog made his debut in the pages of The Cattleman, a magazine for adults, and when Erickson started getting \"Dear Hank\" letters, he knew he was onto something. So in 1983, he self-published 2,000 copies of The Original Adventures of Hank the Cowdog, and they sold out in 6 weeks. <br /><br />When teachers began inviting Erickson to their schools, Hank found his most eager fans. Teachers, librarians, and students alike love Hank. According to some Texas Library Association surveys, the Hank the Cowdog books are the most popular selections in many libraries' children's sections. The lively characters make excellent material for reading and writing lessons, and turn even the most reluctant readers into avid Hank-fans. <br /><br />Erickson was born in Midland, Texas, but by the age of 3, he had moved with his family to Perryton, Texas, where he and his wife live today on their working cattle ranch. They have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren. His advice to young writers is, \"Write about something you know. Try to leave your readers better off than they were before.\"<br />",

In the 1980s, she wrote under her married name young adult's fiction with Eileen Buckholtz, with whom she also wrote romance novels under the pseudonyms: Amanda Lee, Samantha Chase and Rebecca York.

Lawson attended Godolphin and Latymer School and Westminster School before graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, with a degree in Medieval and Modern Languages.<br />Lawson wrote a restaurant column for the <i>Spectator</i> and a comment column for <i>The Observer</i> and became deputy literary editor of the <i>Sunday Times</i> in 1986. She became, among other things, a newspaper-reviewer on BBC1 Sunday-morning TV programme 'Breakfast with Frost'. She has also co-hosted, with David Aaronovitch, Channel 4 books discussion programme 'Booked' in the late 1990s, and was an occasional compere of BBC2's press review 'What the Papers Say', as well as appearing on BBC radio.<br />Following slots as a culinary sidekick on Nigel Slater's 'Real Food Show' on Channel 4, she has fronted three eponymous TV cookery series broadcast in the UK on the channel. She has had two series of 'Nigella Bites' in 1999-2001, plus a 2001 Christmas special, and 'Forever Summer with Nigella' in 2002, both of which yielded accompanying recipe books. Her style of presentation is often gently mocked by comedians and commentators, particularly in a regularly-occurring impersonation of her in the BBC television comedy series 'Dead Ringers', who perceive that she plays overtly upon her attractiveness and sexuality as a device to engage viewers of her cookery programmes, despite Lawson's repeated denials that she does so.<br />She was voted author of the year at the 2001 British Book Awards. More than 2 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide.",

        "biography": "Anne H\u00e9bert was born on August 1, 1916 in Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault, a small village 40 kilometers from Qu\u00e9bec city. Born into a well-respected Qu\u00e9bec family, whose ancestors included some of the earliest settlers of New France, H\u00e9bert was encouraged in her literary endeavours by her cousin, the poet Hector de Saint-Denis Garneau. The greatest influence on her writing, however, was undoubtedly her father Maurice H\u00e9bert, a part-time literary critic who worked for the Qu\u00e9bec government. He fostered her desire to write and, through his guidance, provided her with a solid literary education. Having begun writing poems, stories, and plays at a very young age, Anne H\u00e9bert found her work being published in a variety of periodicals by the time she was in her early twenties. <br /><br />Anne H\u00e9bert's first volume of poetry, Les Songes en \u00e9quilibre, appeared in 1942 to good critical response and it was awarded the Prix David. Despite this success, however, the violence in her 1945 story \"Le Torrent\" and the darkness of her poetry collection Le Tombeau des rois caused Qu\u00e9bec publishers to refuse to publish them. When the former was finally published in 1950 and the latter in 1952, it was done at the personal expense of Roger Lemelin and H\u00e9bert respectively. In 1954 H\u00e9bert used a grant from the Royal Society to continue her writing in Paris, a setting she thought would be more receptive to the style and subject matter of her writing. From that moment on, though she frequently visits Canada, Paris would be her home as well as the location of the publisher of all her subsequent books, the prestigious French publisher Les \u00c9ditions du Seuil. <br />...<br />Fortunately for English readers in Canada and around the world, Anne H\u00e9bert is one of the most translated writers from Qu\u00e9bec. Two volumes of her poetry, Anne H\u00e9bert: Selected Poems (1987) and Day Has No Equal but the Night are still in print, while translations of her plays \"La Merci\u00e8re assassin\u00e9e\" (\"The Murdered Shopkeeper\"), \"Le Temps Sauvage\" (\"The Unquiet State\"), and \"Les Invit\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s\" (\"The Guests on Trial\") were published in the journal Canadian Drama between 1983 and 1988 (issues 9.1, 10.2, and 14.2 respectively). Though some translations of her fiction are currently out of print, the following texts have appeared in English over the years: The Torrent (1973, translated by Gwendolyn Moore), The Silent Rooms (1974, translated by Kathy Mezei), Kamouraska (1974, translated by Norman Shapiro), Children of the Black Sabbath (1977, translated by Carol Dunlop-H\u00e9bert), H\u00e9lo\u00efse (1982, translated by Sheila Fischman), In the Shadow of the Wind (1983, translated by Sheila Fischman), The First Garden (1991, translated by Sheila Fischman and winner of the F\u00e9lix Antoine-Savard Prize for Translation), and Aur\u00e9lien, Clara, Mademoiselle, and the English Lieutenant (1996, translated by Sheila Fischman). Anne H\u00e9bert is also one of the writers from Canada whose work is well known by readers from around the world. Kamouraska, for instance, has been translated into at least seven languages, including Spanish, Italian, German, and Japanese and was adapted for film by Claude Jutra. <br /><br />Over the course of her nearly sixty year career, Anne H\u00e9bert has won many literary awards including the Prix David in 1942 for Les Songes en \u00e9quilibre, the Prix France-Canada and the Prix Duvernay in 1958 for Les Chambres de bois, the Governor General's Literary Award in 1960 for Po\u00e8mes, the Molson Prize in 1967, a second Governor General's Award in 1975 for Les Enfants du sabbat, and the Prix F\u00e9mina in 1982 for Les Fous de Bassan. <br /><br />For her immense contribution to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois literature and for the great impact her work has had on Canadian and international readers, Northwest Passages is pleased to recognize Anne H\u00e9bert as our feature author for the month of March, 1998.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",

Brooks (January 9, 1886 \u2013<br />August 17, 1958) was an American writer best remembered for his short stories and children's books, particularly those about Freddy the Pig and other anthropomorphic animal inhabitants of the \"Bean farm\" in upstate New York.<br /><br />Born in Rome, New York, Brooks attended college at the University of Rochester and subsequently studied homeopathic medicine in New York City. He dropped out after two years, however, and returned to Rochester, where he married his first wife, Anne Shepard, in 1909. Brooks found employment with an advertising agency in Utica, and then \"retired\" in 1911, evidently because he came into a considerable inheritance. His retirement was not permanent: in 1917, he went to work for the American Red Cross and later did editorial work for several magazines, including The New Yorker. <br /><br />In 1940, Brooks turned to his own writing for his full-time occupation. Walter married his second wife, Dorothy Collins, following the death of Anne in 1952. <br /><br />The first works Brooks published were poems and short stories. His short story \"Ed Takes the Pledge\" about a talking horse was the basis for the 1960s television comedy series Mister Ed (credit for creating the characters is given in each episode to \"Walter Brooks\"). His most enduring works, however, are the 26 books he wrote about Freddy the Pig and his friends.<br /><br />Source: &lt; a h r e f = \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_R._Brooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_R...</a> \" &gt;m y l i n k t e x t <br />a &gt;",

For six years he lived and worked in China selling merchandise. During World War I, he was captured by the Japanese, and turned over to the British. He spent five years as a prisoner, most of them in Australia, where his fascination with the animal life inspired him to start sketching again. When he was released, he returned to Germany where he was able to sell all of the artwork he had created while he was detained, in spite of having no formal training. He traveled to Brazil for three years and then to the United States where he was hired by <i>Collier's</i> magazine.<br /><br />Between 1927 and 1931 Wiese wrote and illustrated 7 books and illustrated 26 books for other authors. In 1930 he married Gertrude Hansen, a real estate agent, and they bought a little farmhouse near Frenchtown, New Jersey, where Wiese set up a studio in an old blacksmith shop. He lived and worked there until his death in 1974. <br /><br />In total, during a career of over half a century, Kurt Wiese illustrated over 400 books. He wrote and illustrated 18 books of his own, two of which were Caldecott Honor books.",

He later represented Texas districts in the U.S. House of Representatives (1976\u20131977, 1979\u20131985, and 1997\u2013present). He entered the 1988 presidential election, running as the Libertarian nominee while remaining a registered Republican, and placed a distant third.<br /><br />Paul has been described as conservative, Constitutionalist, and libertarian. He advocates a foreign policy of nonintervention, having voted against actions such as the Iraq War Resolution, but in favor of force against terrorists in Afghanistan. He favors withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations, citing the dangers of foreign entanglements to national sovereignty. Having pledged never to raise taxes, he has long advocated ending the federal income tax, scaling back government spending, abolishing most federal agencies, and removing military bases and troops from foreign soil; he favors hard money and opposes the Federal Reserve. He also opposes the Patriot Act, the federal War on Drugs, No Child Left Behind, and gun control. Paul is strongly pro-life, and has introduced bills to negate Roe v. Wade, but affirms states' rights to regulate or ban abortion, rather than federal jurisdiction.<br /><br />While Paul was a leading 2008 presidential candidate in some Republican straw polls, he saw substantially less support in landline opinion polls and in the actual primaries. Strong internet grassroots support was indicated by his popularity as a web search term, his lead in YouTube subscriptions, and, on December 16th 2007, the largest one-day fundraiser in U.S. political history, netting over $6 million in 24 hours through an independently organized effort. His book commenting on the presidential run, <i>The Revolution: A Manifesto</i>, became a bestseller immediately upon release and went on to be #1 on the <i>New York Times</i> nonfiction best sellers list.<br /><br />Judge Andrew Napolitano calls him \"<i>the Thomas Jefferson of our day.</i>\"<br /><br />Ron Paul, the <i>New York Post</i> once wrote, is a politician who \"<i>cannot be bought by special interests.</i>\"<br /><br />\"<i>There are few people in public life who, through thick and thin, rain or shine, stick to their principles,</i>\" added a congressional colleague. \"<i>Ron Paul is one of those few.</i>\"",

He got his start in journalism in 1989, when he interned at a weekly newspaper in Cross River, entitled \"The Patent Trader\". After graduating from the University of Delaware, he was hired as a food and fashion writer by The Tennessean in Nashville. In 1996, Pearlman was hired by Sports Illustrated, where he spent nearly seven years as a baseball writer.<br /><br />In 2002, Pearlman left Sports Illustrated and spent the next two years at Newsday, but left to focus on writing books. He also keeps an unusually personal online blog, where he posts a weekly Q&amp;A series, The Quaz, with athletes, politicians, actors, singers and many random people. <br /><br />He was a frequent contributor to ESPN.com's Page 2, then as a columnist for SI.com. No stranger to controversy, Pearlman used his own website as a forum to call out the overzealous missionary goals of Tim Tebow's father as \"pretty evil.\" In the fall of 2007, Pearlman wrote several controversial articles on Page 2 regarding the lack of a rivalry between the University of Delaware's and Delaware State University's football teams. The University of Delaware and Delaware State finally played a football game on November 23, 2007 at part of the NCAA Division I FCS playoffs. Delaware won the game with a score of 44\u20137.<br />",

California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he received a degree in classical studies. He has worked in New York as an editor and writer at several magazines, including Esquire; and in Hollywood as a story developer and writer. <br /><br />Robert has lived in London, Paris, and Barcelona; he speaks several languages and has worked as a translator. In 1995 he was involved in the planning and creation of the art school Fabrica, outside Venice, Italy. There he met Joost Elffers, the New York book packager and discussed with him his idea for a book on power and manipulation, the ultimate modern version of Machiavelli's The Prince.<br /><br />Robert and Joost became partners and in 1998, The 48 Laws of Power was born. The book has been a national and international bestseller, and has been translated into 17 languages. In 2001, Robert released his second book, The Art of Seduction, which is more than a sequel to The 48 Laws; it is both a handbook on how to wield the ultimate form of power, and a detailed look at the greatest seducers in history.<br /><br />The third in this highly anticipated series of books, The 33 Strategies of War, hit bookstores January 2006 and offers a strategic look behind the movements of War in application to everyday life. In addition to having a strong following within the business world and a deep following in Washington, DC, these books are also being hailed by everyone from war historians to some of the heaviest hitters in the rap world (including Jay-Z and 50 Cent).<br /><br />The popularity of these books along with their vast and fiercely loyal audience proves these are profound, timeless lessons from historical leaders that still ring true in today's culture. Robert currently lives in Los Angeles.",

        "biography": "I was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in 1943 to a Navy father and mother. <br /><br />I graduated from Duke University in 1965. <br /><br />In January of 1966, when I was on the bus leaving Parris Island as a freshly-minted Marine, I looked back and thought there was at least one good thing about this departure. \"No matter what happens to me for the rest of my life, no one can ever send me back to this freakin' place again.\" <br /><br />Forty years later, to my surprise and gratification, I am far more closely bound to the young men of the Marine Corps and to all other dirt-eating, ground-pounding outfits than I could ever have imagined. <br /><br />GATES OF FIRE is one reason. Dog-eared paperbacks of this tale of the ancient Spartans have circulated throughout platoons of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan since the first days of the invasions. E-mails come in by hundreds. GATES OF FIRE is on the Commandant of the Marine Corps' Reading list. It is taught at West Point and Annapolis and at the Marine Corps Basic School at Quantico. TIDES OF WAR is on the curriculum of the Naval War College.<br /><br />From 2nd Battalion/6th Marines, which calls itself \"the Spartans,\" to ODA 316 of the Special Forces, whose forearms are tattooed with the lambda of Lakedaemon, today's young warriors find a bond to their ancient precursors in the historical narratives of these novels. <br /><br />My struggles to earn a living as a writer (it took seventeen years to get the first paycheck) are detailed in my 2002 book, THE WAR OF ART. <br /><br />I have worked as an advertising copywriter, schoolteacher, tractor-trailer driver, bartender, oilfield roustabout and attendant in a mental hospital. I have picked fruit in Washington state and written screenplays in Tinseltown. <br /><br />With the publication of THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE in 1995, I became a writer of books once and for all. <br /><br />My writing philosophy is, not surprisingly, a kind of warrior code \u2014 internal rather than external \u2014 in which the enemy is identified as those forms of self-sabotage that I have labeled \"Resistance\" with a capital R (in THE WAR OF ART) and the technique for combatting these foes can be described as \"turning pro.\" <br /><br />I believe in previous lives. <br /><br />I believe in the Muse. <br /><br />I believe that books and music exist before they are written and that they are propelled into material being by their own imperative to be born, via the offices of those willing servants of discipline, imagination and inspiration, whom we call artists. My conception of the artist's role is a combination of reverence for the unknowable nature of \"where it all comes from\" and a no-nonsense, blue-collar demystification of the process by which this mystery is approached. In other words, a paradox. <br /><br />There's a recurring character in my books named Telamon, a mercenary of ancient days. Telamon doesn't say much. He rarely gets hurt or wounded. And he never seems to age. His view of the profession of arms is a lot like my conception of art and the artist: <br /><br />\"It is one thing to study war, and another to live the warrior's life.\"<br /><br />",

Back when I was ten years old, my father and I had finished hunting ducks for our dinner and were walking across the tundra in Alaska toward the spot on the river where we\u2019d tied our boat. We had a couple miles to go by boat to get back to the Moravian Children\u2019s Home, where we lived.<br /><br />\u201cMy father was carrying the big bag of decoys and the shotgun; I was carrying the small bag of ducks.<br /><br />\u201cIt was getting dark, we could hear the thud, thud, thud of the generator across the tundra, and suddenly he stopped, pointed down to a pie-pan sized indentation in the tundra that was rapidly filling with water, and said, in a calm and steady voice, \u201cThat\u2019s a bear footprint. From the size of it, it\u2019s a grizzly. The fact that the track is filling with water right now means the bear\u2019s still around.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhich got my attention, but not as much as what he said next.<br /><br />\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t have the gun with me that will kill a bear,\u2019 he told me. \u2018I just have the one that will make him angry. So if we see the bear, I\u2019m going to shoot him so he\u2019ll attack me. I want you to run to the river, follow it to the boat, get the boat back home, and tell everyone what happened.\u2019<br /><br />\u201cThe rest of our walk was very quiet. He was, I\u2019m sure, listening for the bear. I was doing my damnedest to make sure that I remembered where the boat was, how to get to it, how to start the pull-cord engine, and how to drive it back home, because I did not want to let him down.<br /><br />\u201cWe were not eaten by a bear that night\u2026but neither is that walk back from our hunt for supper a part of my life I\u2019ll ever forget.<br /><br />\u201cI keep that story in mind as I write. If what I\u2019m putting on paper isn\u2019t at least as memorable as having a grizzly stalking my father and me across the tundra while I was carrying a bag of delicious-smelling ducks, it doesn\u2019t make my cut.\u201d<br /><br />You can find Holly on her personal site:<br /><a href=\"http://hollylisle.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hollylisle.com</a><br /><br />You can find Cadence Drake, Holly's currently in-progress series, on <i>her</i> site:<br /><a href=\"http://cadencedrake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">CadenceDrake.com</a><br /><br />You can find Holly's books, courses, writing workshops, and so on here:<br /><a href=\"http://howtothinksideways.com/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The HowToThinkSideways.com Shop</a>, as well as on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and in a number of bookstores in the US and around the world.",

        "biography": "Fantasy, alternate-history and science fiction writer Thomas Harlan is the author of the critically acclaimed Oath of Empire series from Tor Books. He has been twice nominated for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Author (in 1999 and 2000). In May of 2001, he received the SF^2 Award for Best New Fantasy Author. His first novel, The Shadow of Ararat was selected as one of the Barnes &amp; Noble Top 20 Best SF&amp;F Novels of 1999. The sequel, Gate of Fire, was chosen as both a B&amp;N Top 20 book and placed on Locus Magazine\u2019s Recommended Reading list for the year 2000. The third and fourth Oath of Empire novels, The Storm of Heaven and The Dark Lord were released in May of 2001 and 2002. A new series followed the cataclysmic end of Oath; an alternate-history science-fiction archaeological/combat series called In the time of the Sixth Sun. The first book, Wasteland of Flint, was published in 2003 and received a starred review in Kirkus. House of Reeds followed in 2004, and Land of the Dead in 2009.<br /><br />Thomas has published a variety of very well received short fiction in Dragon magazine, as well as the largest adventure module ever published in Dungeon. <br /><br />Twenty years of game design have produced a number of play-by-email systems, of which the long-running and increasingly complex Lords of the Earth is the best known. Lords is a historical simulation game, encompassing the whole of the Earth, modeling political, economic and military conflict from the early Iron Age to the late 1800\u2019s. There are over forty Lords of the Earth campaigns currently in progress, in English, Spanish, and Italian. The initial campaign has been running for over twenty years and has chronicled the period from 1000 AD to 1770 AD. Lords of the Earth was nominated for an Origins/GAMA award for Best PBM Game of the Year in 2003.<br /><br />Thomas was born in Tucson, Arizona on February 25th, 1964. He was raised by archaeologist \u2013 dendrochronologist \u2013 botanist parents and traveled widely throughout the American southwest and overseas as a result. A steady diet of Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings), Herbert (Dune), Herge (Tintin), Goscinny &amp; Uderzo (Asterix), John Buchan (Greenmantle, The Thirty-Nine Steps, etc.), Talbot Mundy (The Nine Unknown, Jimgrim, King of the Khyber Rifles), Edgar Rice Burroughs (John Carter of Mars), Kenneth Bulmer (Prescot of Scorpio) and other purveyors of the fantastic inform his literary background. An excessively long stay in college provided him with a moderate background in creative writing, history, art and other sundry skills helpful to a novelist.<br /><br />Aside from his literary career, Thomas spent too many years in the information technology industry as a developer, manager and architect for government, education and healthcare. He currently lives in Salem, Oregon.",

        "biography": "Robert McKee began his show business career at age nine playing the title role in a community theatre production of MARTIN THE SHOEMAKER. He continued acting as a teenager in theatre productions in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Upon receiving the Evans Scholarship, he attended the University of Michigan and earned a Bachelor's Degree in English Literature. While an undergraduate, he acted in and directed over thirty productions. McKee's creative writing professor was the noted Kenneth Rowe whose former students include Arthur Miller and Lawrence Kasdan.<br /><br />After completing his B.A., McKee toured with the APA (Association of Producing Artists) Repertory Company, appearing on Broadway with such luminaries as Helen Hayes, Rosemary Harris and Will Geer. He then received the Professional Theatre Fellowship and returned to Ann Arbor, Michigan to earn his Master's Degree in Theatre Arts.<br /><br />Upon graduating, McKee directed the Toledo Repertory Company, acted with the American Drama Festival, and became Artistic Director of the Aaron Deroy Theatre. From there he traveled to London to accept the position of Artist-In-Residence at the National Theatre where he studied Shakespearean production at the Old Vic. He then returned to New York and spent the next seven years as an actor/director in various Off-Broadway, repertory and stock companies.<br /><br />After deciding to move his career to film, McKee attended Cinema School at the University of Michigan. While there, he directed two short films - A DAY OFF, which he also wrote, and TALK TO ME LIKE THE RAIN, adapted from a one-act play by Tennessee Williams. These two films won the Cine Eagle Award, awards at the Brussels and Grenoble Film Festivals, and various prizes at the Delta, Rochester, Chicago and Baltimore Film Festivals. <br /><br />In 1979, McKee moved to Los Angeles, California where he began to write screenplays and work as a story analyst for United Artists and NBC. He sold his first screenplay, DEAD FILES, to AVCO/Embassy Films, after which he joined the WGA (Writers Guild of America). His next screenplay, HARD KNOCKS, won the National Screenwriting Contest, and since then McKee has had over eight feature film screenplays purchased or optioned, including the feature film script TROPHY for Warner Bros. In addition to his screenplays, McKee has had a number of scripts produced for such critically acclaimed dramatic television series as QUINCY, M.D. (starring Jack Klugman), COLUMBO (starring Peter Falk), SPENSER: FOR HIRE and KOJAK (starring Telly Savalas).<br /><br />In 1983, McKee, a Fulbright Scholar, joined the faculty of the School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California (USC), where he began offering his now famous STORY SEMINAR class. A year later, McKee opened the course to the public and he now teaches the 3-day, 30-hour STORY SEMINAR to sold-out audiences around the world. From Los Angeles (where his course is only taught two times a year) to New York (two times a year) to Paris, Sydney, Toronto, Boston, San Francisco, Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Singapore, Barcelona and 12 other film capitals around the world, more than 50,000 students have taken the course over the last 15+ years. <br /><br />Through it all, McKee continues to be a project consultant to major film and television production companies, as well major software firms (Microsoft, etc.), news departments (ABC, etc.) and more. In addition, several companies such as ABC, Disney, Miramax, PBS, Nickelodeon and Paramount regularly send their entire creative and writing staffs to his lectures. <br /><br />In 2000, McKee won the prestigious 1999 International Moving Image Book Award for his best-selling book STORY (Regan Books/HarperCollins). The book, currently in its 32nd printing in the U.S. and its 19th printing in the U.K., has become required reading for film and cinema schools at such top Universities as Harvard, Yale, UCLA, and USC, and was on the LOS ANGELES TIMES best-seller list for 20 weeks.",

Along with Protagoras, he forms the first generation of Sophists. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. \"Like other Sophists he was an itinerant, practicing in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to invite miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.\" He has been called \"Gorgias the Nihilist\" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.<br /><br />His chief claim to recognition is that he transplanted rhetoric from his native Sicily to Attica, and contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose.",

She was educated at The Select Seminary for Young Ladies and Gentleman until the age of fifteen, at which point the family ironmongery, then being run by her mother, failed, and the family emigrated to Knoxville, Tennessee. Here Hodgson began to write, in order to supplement the family income, assuming full responsibility for the family upon the death of her mother, in 1870. In 1872 she married Dr. Swan Burnett, with whom she had two sons, Lionel and Vivian. The marriage was dissolved in 1898. In 1900 Burnett married actor Stephen Townsend until 1902 when they got divorced. Following her great success as a novelist, playwright, and children's author, Burnett maintained homes in both England and America, traveling back and forth quite frequently. She died in her Long Island, New York home, in 1924.<br /><br />Primarily remembered today for her trio of classic children's novels - <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i> (1886), <i>A Little Princess</i> (1905), and <i>The Secret Garden</i> (1911) - Burnett was also a popular adult novelist, in her own day, publishing romantic stories such as <i>The Making of a Marchioness</i> (1901) for older readers.",

        "biography": "Herodotus was an ancient Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus, Caria (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BCE (c. 484\u2013425 BCE). He has been called \"The Father of History\", as well as \"The Father of Lies.\" He was the first historian known to collect his materials systematically, test their accuracy to a certain extent, and arrange them in a well-constructed and vivid narrative. The Histories\u2014his masterpiece and the only work he is known to have produced\u2014is a record of his \"inquiry\" (or \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 histor\u00eda, a word that passed into Latin and acquired its modern meaning of \"history\"), being an investigation of the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars and including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Although some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate, he claimed he was reporting only what had been told to him. Little is known of his personal history.<br /><br />It was not until the time of Herodotus that gods began to have less influence upon history that was written, yet it was still implied because of the largely accepted view of the Greeks and the expectations that they may have had of how The Histories would be written. History was becoming more of a \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than an amusement. Because of Herodotus wanting people to accept what he had to write, he implemented stories that may have not directly correlated to gods, but rather implemented the idea that miracles or supernatural events took place. As was the story of Arion and the dolphin. While on a boat the men found out that Arion, who was a musician, was worth lots of money and decided to have him killed. The crew gave him two options, that either he jump ship or they kill him on the spot. Arion flung himself into the water and a dolphin carried him to shore.<br /><br />Herodotus was more concerned with putting pleasure before knowledge, unless he did not believe that the gods had a dramatic influence on history and was rather just trying to please his audience. Like the story of the king having his servant look upon his naked wife, and when spotting him hiding, asked him to kill her husband.[78] This, like many stories of Herodotus, are told in great detail, and for the simplicity of dramatic effect. This refers back to the way bards used to tell their poems or stories to their audience. Herodotus was accused by many because of such detailed accounts, and even called a liar by some. In his writing we can already see that there was no direct association with gods.",

These epics lie at the beginning of the Western canon of literature, and have had an enormous influence on the history of literature.<br /><br />When he lived is unknown. Herodotus estimates that Homer lived 400 years before his own time, which would place him at around 850 BCE, while other ancient sources claim that he lived much nearer to the supposed time of the Trojan War, in the early 12th century BCE. Most modern researchers place Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BCE.<br /><br />The formative influence of the Homeric epics in shaping Greek culture was widely recognized, and Homer was described as the teacher of Greece. Homer's works, which are about fifty percent speeches, provided models in persuasive speaking and writing that were emulated throughout the ancient and medieval Greek worlds. Fragments of Homer account for nearly half of all identifiable Greek literary papyrus finds.",

He attended Amherst College, graduating in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The following year, he received his master's degree from Yale University. On June 17, 1956, he married Lynne Duchovnay, a teacher, and they had two children. In 1959, Fagles received his Ph.D in English from Yale and for the next year taught English there.<br /><br />From 1960 to 1962, Fagles was an English instructor at Princeton University. In 1962 he was promoted to Assistant Professor, and in 1965 became an Associate Professor of English and comparative literature. Later that year he became director of the comparative literature program. In 1970, he became a full professor, and from 1975 was the department chair. He retired from teaching as the Arthur W. Marks '19 Professor of Comparative Literaure in 2002, and remained a professor emeritus at Princeton.<br /><br />Between 1961 and 1996, Fagles translated many ancient Greek works. His first translation was of the poetry of Bacchylides, publishing a complete set in 1961. In the 1970s, Fagles began translating much Greek drama, beginning with Aeschylus's <i>The Oresteia</i>. He went on to publish translations of Sophocles's <i>Three Theban Plays</i> (1982) and Homer's <i>Iliad</i> (1990) and <i>Odyssey</i> (1996). In all of the last three, Bernard Knox authored the introduction and notes. Fagles' translations generally emphasize contemporary English phrasing and idiom but are faithful to the original ancient Greek as much as possible.<br /><br />In 1978, Fagles published <i>I, Vincent: Poems from the Pictures of Van Gogh</i>. He was the co-editor of <i>Homer: A Collection of Critical Essays</i> (1962) and <i>Pope's Iliad and Odyssey</i> (1967).<br /><br />Fagles died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey on March 26, 2008, from prostate cancer.",

In performance he also likes to play the drums, much like Ezra Pound.<br /><br />Lombardo is a native of New Orleans. He has a B.A. from Loyola University in New Orleans, an M.A. from Tulane University, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas (1976). In 1976 he joined the faculty at the University of Kansas, where he served as department chair for fifteen years and teaches Greek and Latin at all levels, as well as general courses on Greek literature and culture.

His poetry was much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and greatly influenced Western art and literature. The Metamorphoses remains one of the most important sources of classical mythology.<br /><br />Ovid is traditionally ranked alongside Virgil and Horace, his older contemporaries, as one of the three canonic poets of Latin literature. He was the first major Roman poet to begin his career during the reign of Augustus, and the Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but in one of the mysteries of literary history he was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to carmen et error, \"a poem and a mistake\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.<br /><br />Ovid's prolific poetry includes the Heroides, a collection of verse epistles written as by mythological heroines to the lovers who abandoned them; the Fasti, an incomplete six-book exploration of Roman religion with a calendar structure; and the Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto, two collections of elegies in the form of complaining letters from his exile. His shorter works include the Remedia Amoris (\"Cure for Love\"), the curse-poem Ibis, and an advice poem on women's cosmetics. He wrote a lost tragedy, Medea, and mentions that some of his other works were adapted for staged performance.<br /><br />See also <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16509863.Ovide\" title=\"Ovide\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ovide</a>.",

        "biography": "David Rytman Slavitt (born 23 March 1935 in White Plains, New York) is a writer, poet, and translator, the author of more than 100 books.<br /><br />Slavitt attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where his first writing teacher was Dudley Fitts. He received an undergraduate degree from Yale University (where he studied under Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren and was elected class poet, \"Scholar of the House,\" in 1956), graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (magna cum laude), and then a Master's degree in English from Columbia University in 1957<br /><br />Before becoming a full-time free-lance writer in 1965, Slavitt worked at various jobs in the literary field. These included a stint in the personnel office of Reader's Digest in Pleasantville, New York; teaching English at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta (1957\u20131958); and a variety of jobs at Newsweek in New York. Slavitt began there as a mailroom clerk, was promoted to the positions of book reviewer and film critic, and earned the position of associate editor from 1958 to 1963. He edited the movies pages from 1963 to 1965.<br /><br />Okla Elliott, a professor and Illinois Distinguished Fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, has written of Slavitt that he \"served as an associate editor at Newsweek until 1965, teaching himself Greek on his 35-minute commute. In his last two years at Newsweek, he had a reputation as an astute, sometime cranky, but always readable 'flicker picker' and gained some notoriety for his film reviews there.\"<br /><br />Slavitt taught as an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1977, and at Temple University, in Philadelphia, as associate professor from 1978 to 1980. Slavitt was a lecturer at Columbia University from 1985 to 1986, at Rutgers University in 1987, and at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. He has served as a visiting professor at the University of Texas at El Paso and other institutions. He has given poetry readings at colleges and universities, at the Folger Shakespeare Library, and at the Library of Congress.<br /><br />His first work, a book of poems titled Suits for the Dead, was published in 1961.<br /><br />In the 1960s, Slavitt was approached by Bernie Geis &amp; Associates to write a big book, a popular book, which he agreed to if he could use a pseudonym. As Henry Sutton, in 1967 he published The Exhibitionist, which sold more than 4 million copies. He followed this with The Voyeur in 1968 and three more novels as Henry Sutton. He has also published popular novels under the names of David Benjamin, Lynn Meyer, and Henry Lazarus.<br /><br />Slavitt has published numerous works in translation, especially classics, from Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Spanish and French.<br /><br />Henry S. Taylor, winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, has written, \"David Slavitt is among the most accomplished living practitioners\" of writing, \"in both prose and verse; his poems give us a pleasurable, beautiful way of meditating on a bad time. We can't ask much more of literature, and usually we get far less.\"<br /><br />Novelist and poet James Dickey wrote, \"Slavitt has such an easy, tolerant, believable relationship with the ancient world and its authors that making the change-over from that world to ours is less a leap than an enjoyable stroll. The reader feels a continual sense of gratitude.\"<br /><br />Georgia Jones-Davis, a poet and journalist, has said, \"Slavitt is brilliant and he writes with grace, passion and humor.\"<br /><br />Awards and honors<br /><br />Edgar Award Nominee for Best First Novel for Paperback Thriller, 1976<br /><br />Grant from Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, 1985<br />National Endowment for the Arts Translation Fellowship, 1988<br /><br />Literature award, American Academy of Arts and Letters, 1989<br /><br />Rockefeller Foundation artist's residency, 1989.

        "biography": "<br />Paul West (February 23, 1930) was an English-born novelist, literary historian and poet, the author of 24 novels, who lived in America since the early 1960s. He resided in upstate New York with his wife, the writer, poet and well-known naturalist Diane Ackerman, until his death in 2015. Paul, still remembered with affection by his old colleagues and friends in England as a big, jolly man, was born in Eckington, which is near (and now considered a part of) Sheffield in South Yorkshire, but was during West\u2019s childhood a Derbyshire village associated with the famous literary Sitwells of Renishaw. <br />Paul was honoured with the American Academy of Arts and Letters Literature Award (1985), the Lannan Prize for Fiction (1993), the Grand Prix Halperine-Kaminsky Award (1993), and three Pushcart Prizes (1987, 1991, 2003). He was also a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a New York Public Library Literary Lion (1987), and a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters 1996, France).<br />His parents, Alfred and Mildred, really cared for books, and created an environment which ensured that young Paul inherited a great passion for literature, which was enhanced when he went from his native village to study first at Oxford University in England and later at Columbia University in America. He never lived in England again after going to Columbia, and in later years Paul was involved with other US universities in teaching roles, notably Pennsylvania State University. <br />Paul West\u2019s novels have included: \u2018A Quality of Mercy\u2019 (1961); \u2018Tenement of Clay\u2019 (1965); \u2018Alley Jaggers\u2019 (1966); \u2018I'm Expecting to Live Quite Soon\u2019 (1970); \u2018Bela Lugosi's White Christmas\u2019 (1972); \u2018The Very Rich Hours of Count von Stauffenberg\u2019 (1980); \u2018Rat Man of Paris\u2019 (1986); \u2018The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper\u2019 (1991); and \u2018OK: The Corral, the Earps and Doc Holliday\u2019 (2000). <br />His non-fiction has included the autobiographical \u2018I, Said the Sparrow\u2019, a delightful essay on his Eckington childhood; \u2018The Growth of the Novel\u2019 (1959), \u2018The Modern Novel\u2019 (in 2 vols, 1963); \u2018Robert Penn Warren\u2019 (1964); \u2018Words for a Deaf Daughter\u2019 (1969); \u2018A Stroke of Genius: Illness and Self-discovery\u2019 (1995); and the remarkable \u2018The Shadow Factory\u2019 (2008), the aphasic memoir he dictated with such struggle and resolve \u2013it brings tears to the eyes and admiration to the heart, as we are reminded in reading it of the courage of this man. It is a \u2018must-read\u2019 in the context of the terrible stroke he suffered in 2003. Paul\u2019s wife, Diane, also wrote about that stroke and its consequences in her book \u2018One Hundred Names for Love: A Stroke, a Marriage and the Language of Healing\u2019.

        "biography": "William Shakespeare (baptised 26 April 1564) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"The Bard\"). His surviving works consist of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language, and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<br /><br />Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. Scholars believe that he died on his fifty-second birthday, coinciding with St George\u2019s Day.<br /><br />At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway, who bore him three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of the playing company the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.<br /><br />Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century. Next he wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including <i>Hamlet, King Lear</i>, and <i>Macbeth</i>, considered some of the finest examples in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime, and in 1623, two of his former theatrical colleagues published the <i>First Folio</i>, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.<br /><br />Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the nineteenth century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians hero-worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \"bardolatry\". In the twentieth century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are consistently performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.<br /><br />According to historians, Shakespeare wrote 37 plays and 154 sonnets throughout the span of his life. Shakespeare's writing average was 1.5 plays a year since he first started writing in 1589. There have been plays and sonnets attributed to Shakespeare that were not authentically written by the great master of language and literature. <br />",

Thucydides has been dubbed the father of \"scientific history\" due to his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis in terms of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work.<br /><br />He has also been called the father of the school of political realism, which views the relations between nations as based on might rather than right. His classical text is still studied at advanced military colleges worldwide, and the Melian dialogue remains a seminal work of international relations theory.<br /><br />More generally, Thucydides showed an interest in developing an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as plague, genocide (as practised against the Melians), and civil war.<br /><br /><i>Excerpted from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</i>",

        "biography": "Gustave Flaubert (December 12, 1821 \u2013 May 8, 1880) is counted among the greatest Western novelists. He was born in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, in the Haute-Normandie Region of France.<br /><br />Flaubert's curious modes of composition favored and were emphasized by these peculiarities. He worked in sullen solitude, sometimes occupying a week in the completion of one page, never satisfied with what he had composed, violently tormenting his brain for the best turn of a phrase, the most absolutely final adjective. It cannot be said that his incessant labors were not rewarded. His private letters show that he was not one of those to whom easy and correct language is naturally given; he gained his extraordinary perfection with the unceasing sweat of his brow. One of the most severe of academic critics admits that in all his works, and in every page of his works, Flaubert may be considered a model of style.<br /><br />That he was one of the greatest writers who ever lived in France is now commonly admitted, and his greatness principally depends upon the extraordinary vigour and exactitude of his style. Less perhaps than any other writer, not of France, but of modern Europe, Flaubert yields admission to the inexact, the abstract, the vaguely inapt expression which is the bane of ordinary methods of composition. He never allowed a clich\u00e9 to pass him, never indulgently or wearily went on, leaving behind him a phrase which almost expressed his meaning. Being, as he is, a mixture in almost equal parts of the romanticist and the realist, the marvellous propriety of his style has been helpful to later writers of both schools, of every school. The absolute exactitude with which he adapts his expression to his purpose is seen in all parts of his work, but particularly in the portraits he draws of the figures in his principal romances. The degree and manner in which, since his death, the fame of Flaubert has extended, form an interesting chapter of literary history.<br /><br />The publication of Madame Bovary in 1857 had been followed by more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel was the beginning of something new, the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually this aspect of his genius was accepted, and began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death he was famous as a realist, pure and simple. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over \u00c9mile de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet and Zola. But even after the decline of the realistic school Flaubert did not lose prestige; other facets of his genius caught the light. It has been perceived that he was not merely realistic, but real; that his clairvoyance was almost boundless; that he saw certain phenomena more clearly than the best of observers had done. Flaubert is a writer who must always appeal more to other authors than to the world at large, because the art of writing, the indefatigable pursuit of perfect expression, were always before him, and because he hated the lax felicities of improvisation as a disloyalty to the most sacred procedures of the literary artist.<br /><br />He can be said to have made cynicism into an art-form, as evinced by this observation from 1846:<br /><br />To be stupid, and selfish, and to have good health are the three requirements for happiness; though if stupidity is lacking, the others are useless. <br /><br />His Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes (8 vols., 1885) were printed from the original manuscripts, and included, besides the works mentioned already, the two plays, Le Candidat and Le Ch\u00e2teau des avurs. Another edition (10 vols.) appeared in 1873\u20131885. Flaubert's correspondence with George Sand was published in 1884 with an introduction by Guy de Maupassant.<br /><br />He has been admired or written about by almost every major literary personality of the 20th century, including philosophers such as Pierre Bourdieu. Georges Perec named Sentimental Education as one of his favou",

Judged solely in terms of his philosophical influence, only Plato is his peer: Aristotle's works shaped centuries of philosophy from Late Antiquity through the Renaissance, and even today continue to be studied with keen, non-antiquarian interest. A prodigious researcher and writer, Aristotle left a great body of work, perhaps numbering as many as two-hundred treatises, from which approximately thirty-one survive. His extant writings span a wide range of disciplines, from logic, metaphysics and philosophy of mind, through ethics, political theory, aesthetics and rhetoric, and into such primarily non-philosophical fields as empirical biology, where he excelled at detailed plant and animal observation and taxonomy. In all these areas, Aristotle's theories have provided illumination, met with resistance, sparked debate, and generally stimulated the sustained interest of an abiding readership.<br /><br />Because of its wide range and its remoteness in time, Aristotle's philosophy defies easy encapsulation. The long history of interpretation and appropriation of Aristotelian texts and themes\u2014spanning over two millennia and comprising philosophers working within a variety of religious and secular traditions\u2014has rendered even basic points of interpretation controversial. The set of entries on Aristotle in this site addresses this situation by proceeding in three tiers. First, the present, general entry offers a brief account of Aristotle's life and characterizes his central philosophical commitments, highlighting his most distinctive methods and most influential achievements. Second are General Topics which offer detailed introductions to the main areas of Aristotle's philosophical activity. Finally, there follow Special Topics which investigate in greater detail more narrowly focused issues, especially those of central concern in recent Aristotelian scholarship",

        "biography": "<b>Thomas Hardy</b>, OM, was an English author of the naturalist movement, although in several poems he displays elements of the previous romantic and enlightenment periods of literature, such as his fascination with the supernatural. He regarded himself primarily as a poet and composed novels mainly for financial gain. The bulk of his work, set mainly in the semi-fictional land of Wessex, delineates characters struggling against their passions and circumstances. Hardy's poetry, first published in his 50s, has come to be as well regarded as his novels, especially after The Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The term <i>\n  <b>cliffhanger</b>\n</i> is considered to have originated with Thomas Hardy's serial novel <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110077.A_Pair_of_Blue_Eyes\" title=\"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Pair of Blue Eyes</a> in 1873. In the novel, Hardy chose to leave one of his protagonists, Knight, literally hanging off a cliff staring into the stony eyes of a trilobite embedded in the rock that has been dead for millions of years. This became the archetypal \u2014 and literal \u2014 cliff-hanger of Victorian prose.<br /><br /><i>Excerpted from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</i>",

Ancient scholars thought that Euripides had written ninety-five plays, although four of those were probably written by Critias. Eighteen of Euripides' plays have survived complete. It is now widely believed that what was thought to be a nineteenth, Rhesus, was probably not by Euripides. Fragments, some substantial, of most of the other plays also survive. More of his plays have survived than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly because of the chance preservation of a manuscript that was probably part of a complete collection of his works in alphabetical order.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides</a>",

He was fluent in Yiddish, German, ancient Hebrew, ancient Greek, Latin, French, and Italian, and well-versed in other languages.<br /><br />His most productive years were spent at Columbia University, where he was a colleague of Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling. There, he took his talent for languages, combined it with a popularizing impulse, to buck the prevailing classical methods of the day\u2014textual criticism and grammar\u2014presenting classics, even in translation, as worthy of study as literary works in their own right.<br /><br />This approach may be compared to the New Criticism school: even as the New Critics emphasized close reading, eschewing outside sources and cumbersome apparatus, Hadas, in presenting classical works in translation to an influx of post-war G.I. Bill students, brought forth an appreciation of his domain for those without the specialized training of classicists.<br /><br />His popularizing impulse led him to embrace television as a tool for education, becoming a telelecturer and a pundit on broadcast television. He also recorded classical works on phonograph and tape.<br />",

        "biography": "Dale Breckenridge Carnegie (originally Carnagey until 1922 and possibly somewhat later) (November 24, 1888 \u2013 November 1, 1955) was an American writer and lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking and interpersonal skills. Born in poverty on a farm in Missouri, he was the author of How to Win Friends and Influence People, first published in 1936, a massive bestseller that remains popular today. He also wrote a biography of Abraham Lincoln, titled Lincoln the Unknown, as well as several other books.<br /><br />Carnegie was an early proponent of what is now called responsibility assumption, although this only appears minutely in his written work. One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people's behavior by changing one's reaction to them.<br /><br />Born in 1888 in Maryville, Missouri, Carnegie was a poor farmer's boy, the second son of James William Carnagey and wife Amanda Elizabeth Harbison (b. Missouri, February 1858 \u2013 living 1910). In his teens, though still having to get up at 4 a.m. every day to milk his parents' cows, he managed to get educated at the State Teacher's College in Warrensburg. His first job after college was selling correspondence courses to ranchers; then he moved on to selling bacon, soap and lard for Armour &amp; Company. He was successful to the point of making his sales territory of South Omaha, Nebraska the national leader for the firm.<br /><br />After saving $500, Carnegie quit sales in 1911 in order to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a Chautauqua lecturer. He ended up instead attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, but found little success as an actor, though it is written that he played the role of Dr. Hartley in a road show of Polly of the Circus.[citation needed] When the production ended, he returned to New York, unemployed, nearly broke, and living at the YMCA on 125th Street. It was there that he got the idea to teach public speaking, and he persuaded the \"Y\" manager to allow him to instruct a class in return for 80% of the net proceeds. In his first session, he had run out of material; improvising, he suggested that students speak about \"something that made them angry\", and discovered that the technique made speakers unafraid to address a public audience. From this 1912 debut, the Dale Carnegie Course evolved. Carnegie had tapped into the average American's desire to have more self-confidence, and by 1914, he was earning $500 - the equivalent of nearly $10,000 now - every week.<br /><br />Perhaps one of Carnegie\u2019s most successful marketing moves was to change the spelling of his last name from \u201cCarnegey\u201d to Carnegie, at a time when Andrew Carnegie (unrelated) was a widely revered and recognized name. By 1916, Dale was able to rent Carnegie Hall itself for a lecture to a packed house. Carnegie's first collection of his writings was Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men (1926), later entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business (1932). His crowning achievement, however, was when Simon &amp; Schuster published How to Win Friends and Influence People. The book was a bestseller from its debut in 1937, in its 17th printing within a few months. By the time of Carnegie's death, the book had sold five million copies in 31 languages, and there had been 450,000 graduates of his Dale Carnegie Institute. It has been stated in the book that he had critiqued over 150,000 speeches in his participation of the adult education movement of the time. During World War I he served in the U.S. Army.<br /><br />His first marriage ended in divorce in 1931. On November 5, 1944, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he married Dorothy Price Vanderpool, who also had been divorced. Vanderpool had two daughters; Rosemary, from her first marriage, and Donna Dale from their marriage together.<br /><br />Carnegie died at Forest Hills, New York, and was buried in the Belton, Cass County, Missouri cemetery.

He is the earliest of the three Greek tragedians whose plays survive extant, the others being Sophocles and Euripides. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in plays to allow for conflict among them; previously, characters interacted only with the chorus. Unfortunately, only seven of an estimated 70 plays by Aeschylus have survived into modern times; one of these plays, <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, is sometimes thought not to be the work of Aeschylus.<br /><br />At least one of Aeschylus's works was influenced by the Persian invasion of Greece, which took place during his lifetime. His play <i>The Persians</i> remains a good primary source of information about this period in Greek history. The war was so important to Greeks and to Aeschylus himself that, upon his death around 456 BC, his epitaph included a reference to his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon but not to his success as a playwright.<br /><br />There are no reliable sources for the life of Aeschylus. He was said to have been born in c. 525 in Eleusis, a small town about 27 kilometers northwest of Athens, which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western Attica, though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was both wealthy and well-established; his father Euphorion was a member of the Eupatridae, the ancient nobility of Attica.<br /><br />As a youth, he worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer Pausanias, the god Dionysus visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy. As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began writing a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old. After fifteen years, his skill was great enough to win a prize for his plays at Athens' annual city Dionysia playwriting competition. But in the interim, his dramatic career was interrupted by war. The armies of the Persian Empire, which had already conquered the Greek city-states of Ionia, entered mainland Greece in the hopes of conquering it as well.<br /><br />In 490 BC, Aeschylus and his brother Cynegeirus fought to defend Athens against Darius's invading Persian army at the Battle of Marathon. Though Athens was victorious, Cynegeirus died in the battle. Aeschylus continued to write plays during the lull between the first and second Persian invasions of Greece, and won his first victory at the city Dionysia in 484 BC. In 480 he was called into military service again, this time against Xerxes' invading forces at the Battle of Salamis. This naval battle holds a prominent place in The Persians, his oldest surviving play, which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the Dionysia.<br /><br />Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who had been initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult to Demeter based in his hometown of Eleusis. As the name implies, members of the cult were supposed to have gained some sort of mystical, secret knowledge. Firm details of the Mysteries' specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to Aristotle, it was alleged that Aeschylus had placed clues about the secret rites in his seventh tragedy, <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. According to some sources, an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. When he stood trial for his offense, Aeschylus pleaded ignorance and was only spared because of his brave service in the Persian Wars.<br /><br />Aeschylus traveled to Sicily once or twice in the 470s BC, having",

They are <i>The Acharnians</i>, <i>The Birds</i>, <i>The Clouds</i>, <i>The Ecclesiazusae</i>, <i>The Frogs</i>, <i>The Knights</i>, <i>Peace</i>, <i>Plutus</i> (Wealth), <i>The Thesmophoriazusae</i>, and <i>The Wasps</i>. These plays have been translated into many languages and continue to be staged or adapted for theatrical productions.<br /><br />Aristophanes satirized the political and social issues of 5th-century-BC Athens, such as the ongoing Peloponnesian War, the structure of the city-state, the role of women in public life, and the influence of philosophers (notably Socrates) in shaping public opinion. <br /><br /><br />",

As a person of Jewish ancestry, Strauss fled to the United States during the rule of Third Reich and taught at the University of Chicago. There, he wrote commentaries on ancient Greek thought of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the medieval philosophy of Maimonides and Islamic philosophers, and expounded his thought on political philosophy. His legacy remains in the realm of political theories to this day.",

He was educated at Uppingham School and Merton College, Oxford, where he studied English.<br /><br />In 2003, Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and in 2004, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best First Book for his novel <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</i>, a book which is written from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers syndrome. Haddon's knowledge of Aspergers syndrome, a type of autism, comes from his work with autistic people as a young man. In an interview at Powells.com, Haddon claimed that this was the first book that he wrote intentionally for an adult audience; he was surprised when his publisher suggested marketing it to both adult and child audiences. His second adult-novel, <i>A Spot of Bother</i>, was published in September 2006.<br /><br />Mark Haddon is also known for his series of Agent Z books, one of which, <i>Agent Z and the Penguin from Mars</i>, was made into a 1996 Children's BBC sitcom. He also wrote the screenplay for the BBC television adaptation of Raymond Briggs's story Fungus the Bogeyman, screened on BBC1 in 2004. He also wrote the 2007 BBC television drama Coming Down the Mountain.<br /><br />Haddon is a vegetarian, and enjoys vegetarian cookery. He describes himself as a 'hard-line atheist'. In an interview with The Observer, Haddon said \"I am atheist in a very religious mould\". His atheism might be inferred from <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</i> in which the main character declares that those who believe in God are stupid.<br /><br />Mark Haddon lives in Oxford with his wife Dr. Sos Eltis, a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, and their two young sons.",

Ha escrito varios libros de ensayo sobre el hombre en la crisis de nuestro tiempo y sobre el sentido de la actividad literaria \u2014as\u00ed, <i>El escritor y sus fantasmas</i>, <i>Apolog\u00edas y rechazos</i>, <i>Uno y el Universo</i> y <i>La resistencia</i>\u2014, su autobiograf\u00eda, <i>Antes del fin</i>, y tres novelas: <i>El t\u00fanel</i>, <i>Sobre h\u00e9roes y tumbas</i> y <i>Abadd\u00f3n, el exterminador</i>. Escritores tan dispares como Camus, Greene y Thomas Mann, como Quasimodo y Piovene, como Gombrowicz y Nadeau han escrito con admiraci\u00f3n sobre su obra, que ha obtenido el Premio Cervantes, el Premio Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, el Premio Jerusal\u00e9n y la Medalla de Oro del C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid.<br /><br />Ernesto Sabato was an Argentine writer, painter and physicist. According to the BBC he \"won some of the most prestigious prizes in Hispanic literature\" and \"became very influential in the literary world throughout Latin America\". Upon his death El Pa\u00eds dubbed him the \"last classic writer in Argentine literature\".<br /><br />Sabato was born in Rojas, a small town in Buenos Aires Province. Sabato began his studies at the Colegio Nacional de La Plata. He then studied physics at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where he earned a Ph.D. He then attended the Sorbonne in Paris and worked at the Curie Institute. After World War II, he lost faith in science and started writing.<br /><br />Sabato's oeuvre includes three novels: El T\u00fanel (1948), Sobre h\u00e9roes y tumbas (1961) and Abadd\u00f3n el exterminador (1974). The first of these received critical acclaim upon its publication from, among others, fellow writers Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. The second is regarded as his masterpiece, though he nearly burnt it like many of his other works. Sabato's essays cover topics as diverse as metaphysics, politics and tango. His writings led him to receive many international prizes, including the Legion of Honour (France), the Prix M\u00e9dicis (Italy) and the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (Spain).",

He was a Latin philosopher and theologian from the Africa Province of the Roman Empire and is generally considered as one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all times. His writings were very influential in the development of Western Christianity. According to his contemporary Jerome, Augustine \"established anew the ancient Faith.\" In his early years he was heavily influenced by Manichaeism and afterward by the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus. After his conversion to Christianity and his baptism in 387, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives. He believed that the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, and he framed the concepts of original sin and just war. When the Western Roman Empire was starting to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the Catholic Church as a spiritual City of God (in a book of the same name), distinct from the material Earthly City. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Augustine's City of God was closely identified with the Church, the community that worshiped the Trinity. In the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, he is a saint and pre-eminent Doctor of the Church. Many Protestants, especially Calvinists, consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the Protestant Reformation due to his teaching on salvation and divine grace. In the Eastern Orthodox Church he is also considered a saint. He carries the additional title of Blessed.

        "biography": "Barbara Mary Willard was born in Brighton, Sussex in 1909, and was educated at a convent school in Southampton. Her father was a Shakespearean actor; she absorbed Shakespeare from childhood and language was always important to her. Before the war she worked briefly as an actress and a playreader, before starting to write fiction. Barbara Willard wrote many adult novels before venturing into children's fiction; late in her writing career came the historical series known as the Mantlemass novels, and it is for these that she is now chiefly remembered. In 1967 she published A Grove of Green Holly (not one of the series) about a group of 17th century travelling players, hiding from Cromwell's soldiers in Ashdown Forest in Sussex, encountering iron workers and forest ways. From this root came the idea of writing about the same place and its development and change through earlier periods of history; a concept which was to evolve into the Mantlemass books. This series has received much critical acclaim and has ensured Barbara Willard a place in the mainstream of children's historical fiction, along with writers such as Geoffrey Trease, Rosemary Sutcliff and Cynthia Harnett. Two early volumes were runners up for the Guardian award for children's fiction, which she won with The Iron Lily in 1974. <br /><br />(courtesy Belinda Copson)",

        "biography": "Edward James Hughes was an English poet and children's writer, known as Ted Hughes. His most characteristic verse is without sentimentality, emphasizing the cunning and savagery of animal life in harsh, sometimes disjunctive lines.<br /><br />The dialect of Hughes's native West Riding area of Yorkshire set the tone of his verse. At Pembroke College, Cambridge, he found folklore and anthropology of particular interest, a concern that was reflected in a number of his poems. In 1956 he married the American poet <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4379.Sylvia_Plath\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sylvia Plath</a>. The couple made a visit to the United States in 1957, the year that his first volume of verse, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256072.The_Hawk_in_the_Rain_Poems\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>The Hawk in the Rain</i>\n</a>, was published. Other works soon followed. <br /><br />Hughes stopped writing poetry almost completely for nearly three years following Plath's suicide in 1963 (the couple had separated earlier), but thereafter he published prolifically, often in collaboration with photographers and illustrators, as in <i>Under the North Star</i> (1981). He wrote many volumes for children, including <i>Remains of Elmet </i>(1979), in which he recalled the world of his childhood. From 1965 he was co-editor of the magazine Modern Poetry in Translation in London. Some of Hughes's essays on subjects of literary and cultural criticism were published as <i>Winter Pollen </i>(1994). After decades of silence on the subject of his marriage to Plath, Hughes addressed it in the poems of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313277.Birthday_Letters_Poems\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Birthday Letters </i>\n</a>(1998). In 1984 he was appointed Britain's poet laureate.<br /><br />Ted Hughes was the father of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/157481.Frieda_Hughes\" title=\"Frieda Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frieda Hughes</a> and the brother of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/540000.Gerald_Hughes\" title=\"Gerald Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerald Hughes</a>.",

Green's most famous books are Alexander of Macedon, a historical biography first issued in 1970, then in a revised and expanded edition in 1974, which was first published in the United States in 1991; his Alexander to Actium, a general account of the Hellenistic Age, and other works. He is the author of a translation of the Satires of the Roman poet Juvenal, now in its third edition.<br /><br />In the Second World War he served in Burma and afterwards studied classics at Cambridge University. After working as a journalist and writing historical novels, he taught classics in Athens until 1971, when he became Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin. In 1997 he became Emeritus Professor of Classics at Austin. He has been Visiting Professor at various universities in the USA.",

Jesuit-educated, he began writing clever verses by the age of 12. He launched a lifelong, successful playwriting career in 1718, interrupted by imprisonment in the Bastille. Upon a second imprisonment, in which Francois adopted the pen name Voltaire, he was released after agreeing to move to London. There he wrote <i>Lettres philosophiques</i> (1733), which galvanized French reform. The book also satirized the religious teachings of Rene Descartes and Blaise Pascal, including Pascal's famed \"wager\" on God. Voltaire wrote: \"The interest I have in believing a thing is not a proof of the existence of that thing.\" Voltaire's French publisher was sent to the Bastille and Voltaire had to escape from Paris again, as judges sentenced the book to be \"torn and burned in the Palace.\" Voltaire spent a calm 16 years with his deistic mistress, Madame du Chatelet, in Lorraine. He met the 27 year old married mother when he was 39. In his memoirs, he wrote: \"I found, in 1733, a young woman who thought as I did, and decided to spend several years in the country, cultivating her mind.\" He dedicated <i>Traite de metaphysique</i> to her. In it the Deist candidly rejected immortality and questioned belief in God. It was not published until the 1780s. Voltaire continued writing amusing but meaty philosophical plays and histories. After the earthquake that leveled Lisbon in 1755, in which 15,000 people perished and another 15,000 were wounded, Voltaire wrote <i>Po\u00e8me sur le d\u00e9sastre de Lisbonne</i> (<i>Poem on the Lisbon Disaster</i>): \"But how conceive a God supremely good/ Who heaps his favours on the sons he loves,/ Yet scatters evil with as large a hand?\"<br /><br />Voltaire purchased a chateau in Geneva, where, among other works, he wrote <i>Candide</i> (1759). To avoid Calvinist persecution, Voltaire moved across the border to Ferney, where the wealthy writer lived for 18 years until his death. Voltaire began to openly challenge Christianity, calling it \"the infamous thing.\" He wrote Frederick the Great: \"Christianity is the most ridiculous, the most absurd, and bloody religion that has ever infected the world.\" Voltaire ended every letter to friends with \"Ecrasez l'infame\" (crush the infamy \u2014 the Christian religion). His pamphlet, <i>The Sermon on the Fifty</i> (1762) went after transubstantiation, miracles, biblical contradictions, the Jewish religion, and the Christian God. Voltaire wrote that a true god \"surely cannot have been born of a girl, nor died on the gibbet, nor be eaten in a piece of dough,\" or inspired \"books, filled with contradictions, madness, and horror.\" He also published excerpts of <i>Testament of the Abbe Meslier</i>, by an atheist priest, in Holland, which advanced the Enlightenment. Voltaire's <i>Philosophical Dictionary</i> was published in 1764 without his name. Although the first edition immediately sold out, Geneva officials, followed by Dutch and Parisian, had the books burned. It was published in 1769 as two large volumes. Voltaire campaigned fiercely against civil atrocities in the name of religion, writing pamphlets and commentaries about the barbaric execution of a Huguenot trader, who was first broken at the wheel, then burned at the stake, in 1762. Voltaire's campaign for justice and restitution ended with a posthumous retrial in 1765, during which 40 Parisian judges declared the defendant innocent. Voltaire urgently tried to save the life of Chevalier de la Barre, a 19 year old sentenced to death for blasphemy for failing to remove his hat during a religious procession. In 1766, Chevalier was beheaded after being tortured, then his body was burned, along with a copy of Voltaire's <i>Philosophical Dictionary</i>. Voltaire's statue at the Pantheon was melted down during Nazi occupation. D. 1778.<br /><br />Voltaire (1694-1778), pseud\u00f3nimo de Fran\u00e7ois-",

        "biography": "Harold Pinter, CH, CBE, was an English playwright, screenwriter, actor, director, political activist and poet. He was one of the most influential playwrights of modern times. In 2005 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />After publishing poetry and acting in school plays as a teenager in London, Pinter began his professional theatrical career in 1951, touring throughout Ireland. From 1952, he acted in repertory companies throughout England for about a dozen years, using the stage name David Baron in the late 1950s. Beginning with his first play, <i>The Room</i> (1957), Pinter's writing career spanned over 50 years and produced 29 original stage plays, 27 screenplays, many dramatic sketches, radio and TV plays, poetry, one novel, short fiction, essays, speeches, and letters. His best-known plays include <i>The Birthday Party</i> (1957), <i>The Caretaker</i> (1959), <i>The Homecoming</i> (1964), and <i>Betrayal</i> (1978), each of which he adapted to film. His screenplay adaptations of others' works include <i>The Servant</i> (1963), <i>The Go-Between</i> (1970), <i>The French Lieutenant's Woman</i> (1981), <i>The Trial</i> (1993), and <i>Sleuth</i> (2007). He directed almost 50 stage, television, and film productions and acted extensively in radio, stage, television, and film productions of his own and others' works. Despite frail health after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role in a critically-acclaimed stage production of Samuel Beckett's one-act monologue <i>Krapp's Last Tape</i>, for the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006.<br /><br />Pinter's dramas often involve strong conflicts among ambivalent characters who struggle for verbal and territorial dominance and for their own versions of the past. Stylistically, these works are marked by theatrical pauses and silences, comedic timing, irony, and menace. Thematically ambiguous, they raise complex issues of individual identity oppressed by social forces, language, and vicissitudes of memory. In 1981, Pinter stated that he was not inclined to write plays explicitly about political subjects; yet in the mid-1980s he began writing overtly political plays, reflecting his own heightening political interests and changes in his personal life. This \"new direction\" in his work and his left-wing political activism stimulated additional critical debate about Pinter's politics. Pinter, his work, and his politics have been the subject of voluminous critical commentary.<br /><br />Pinter received numerous awards. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received the Tony Award for Best Play in 1967 for <i>The Homecoming</i>. He was given BAFTA awards, the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur and 20 honorary degrees. Festivals and symposia have been devoted to him and his work. In awarding the Nobel Prize, the Swedish Academy noted, \"That he occupies a position as a modern classic is illustrated by his name entering the language as an adjective used to describe a particular atmosphere and environment in drama: 'Pinteresque'\". He died from liver cancer on 24 December 2008. He was buried the following week at Kensal Green Cemetery in North West London.<br />",

Snyder is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Since the 1970s, he has frequently been described as the 'laureate of Deep Ecology'. From the 1950s on, he has published travel-journals and essays from time to time. His work in his various roles reflects his immersion in both Buddhist spirituality and nature. Snyder has also translated literature into English from ancient Chinese and modern Japanese. As a social critic, Snyder has much in common with Lewis Mumford, Aldous Huxley, Karl Hess, Aldo Leopold, and Karl Polanyi. Snyder was for many years on the faculty of the University of California, Davis, and for a time served on the California Arts Council.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br /><i>Gary Snyder.

John grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles (which he hated), and spent his boyhood summers on his grandfather\u2019s cattle ranch in eastern Oregon (which he loved). John met his wife Stasi in high school (in drama class). But their romance did not begin until they each came to faith in Christ, after high school. John earned his undergraduate degree in Theater at Cal Poly, and directed a theater company in Los Angeles for several years before moving to Colorado with Focus on the Family, where he taught at the Focus on the Family Institute.<br /><br />John earned his master\u2019s degree in Counseling from Colorado Christian University, under the direction of Larry Crabb and Dan Allender. He worked as a counselor in private practice before launching Ransomed Heart in 2000. John and Stasi live in Colorado Springs with their three sons (Samuel, Blaine and Luke), their golden retriever (Oban), and two horses (Whistle and Kokolo). While all of this is factually true, it somehow misses describing an actual person. He loves the outdoors passionately, and all beauty, Shakespeare, bow hunting, a good cigar, anything having to do with adventure, poetry, March Madness, working in the shop, fly fishing, classic rock, the Tetons, fish tacos, George MacDonald, green tea, buffalo steaks, dark chocolate, wild and open places, horses running, and too much more to name. He also uses the expression \u201cfar out\u201d way too much. <br />",

        "biography": "I took a roundabout path to becoming a children's author. Out of college I did temporary work in offices and libraries, while at night, I wrote poetry and made strange life forms from cloth. When I teamed up with a puppeteer, Bob Kaminski (my husband), I was able to bring my cloth creations to life. We began performing on the streets of San Francisco, at Renaissance fairs, and at schools. After attending a workshop on Balinese shadow puppetry, we traveled to Bali and Java to learn ancient techniques from modern masters, and we adapted material from American folklore to the shadow screen. I became so fascinated by the power of ancient myth and folktale to engage a modern audience that I enrolled in the Folklore and Mythology Program at UCLA, where I received my Ph.D. While I was a student there, I attended a talk by the author-illustrator Uri Shulevitz, and heard him say that a picture book is like a small theater. A puppet theater is also a small theater, I thought. I can do that! My first children's books were adaptations of folktales, and soon, I was able to incorporate my lifelong habit of writing poetry into my work.<br /><br />Currently (2018), I live in Portland, Oregon, with my husband. I divide my writing time between children's books and a long term project on folktales, grandmothers and cultural evolution.<br />",

His writings on power, knowledge, and discourse have been widely influential in academic circles. In the 1960s Foucault was associated with structuralism, a movement from which he distanced himself. Foucault also rejected the poststructuralist and postmodernist labels later attributed to him, preferring to classify his thought as a critical history of modernity rooted in Immanuel Kant. Foucault's project was particularly influenced by Nietzsche, his \"genealogy of knowledge\" being a direct allusion to Nietzsche's \"genealogy of morality\". In a late interview he definitively stated: \"I am a Nietzschean.\"<br /><br />Foucault was listed as the most cited scholar in the humanities in 2007 by the ISI Web of Science.",

These terms refer to the virtual or unreal nature of contemporary culture in an age of mass communication and mass consumption. We live in a world dominated by simulated experiences and feelings, Jean Baudrillard believes, and have lost the capacity to comprehend reality as it actually exists. We experience only prepared realities--edited war footage, meaningless acts of terrorism, the destruction of cultural values and the substitution of 'referendum'. <br /><br />In Jean Baudrillard's words,<br /><br /><i>\"The very definition of the real has become: that of which it is possible to give an equivalent reproduction...The real is not only what can be reproduced, but that which is always already reproduced: that is the hyperreal...which is entirely in simulation.\"</i>",

She and her three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth and May were educated by their father, philosopher/ teacher, Bronson Alcott and raised on the practical Christianity of their mother, Abigail May.<br /><br />Louisa spent her childhood in Boston and in Concord, Massachusetts, where her days were enlightened by visits to Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s library, excursions into nature with Henry David Thoreau and theatricals in the barn at Hillside (now Hawthorne\u2019s \"Wayside\").<br /><br />Like her character, Jo March in Little Women, young Louisa was a tomboy: \"No boy could be my friend till I had beaten him in a race,\" she claimed, \" and no girl if she refused to climb trees, leap fences....\"<br /><br />For Louisa, writing was an early passion. She had a rich imagination and often her stories became melodramas that she and her sisters would act out for friends. Louisa preferred to play the \"lurid\" parts in these plays, \"the villains, ghosts, bandits, and disdainful queens.\"<br /><br />At age 15, troubled by the poverty that plagued her family, she vowed: \"I will do something by and by. Don\u2019t care what, teach, sew, act, write, anything to help the family; and I\u2019ll be rich and famous and happy before I die, see if I won\u2019t!\"<br /><br />Confronting a society that offered little opportunity to women seeking employment, Louisa determined \"...I will make a battering-ram of my head and make my way through this rough and tumble world.\" Whether as a teacher, seamstress, governess, or household servant, for many years Louisa did any work she could find.<br /><br />Louisa\u2019s career as an author began with poetry and short stories that appeared in popular magazines. In 1854, when she was 22, her first book Flower Fables was published. A milestone along her literary path was Hospital Sketches (1863) based on the letters she had written home from her post as a nurse in Washington, DC as a nurse during the Civil War.<br /><br />When Louisa was 35 years old, her publisher Thomas Niles in Boston asked her to write \"a book for girls.\" Little Women was written at Orchard House from May to July 1868. The novel is based on Louisa and her sisters\u2019 coming of age and is set in Civil War New England. Jo March was the first American juvenile heroine to act from her own individuality; a living, breathing person rather than the idealized stereotype then prevalent in children\u2019s fiction.<br /><br />In all, Louisa published over 30 books and collections of stories. She died on March 6, 1888, only two days after her father, and is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord.",

Friedman is an internationally renowned author, reporter, and, columnist\u2014the recipient of three Pulitzer Prizes and the author of six bestselling books, among them <i>From Beirut to Jerusalem</i> and <i>The World Is Flat</i>.<br /><br />Thomas Loren Friedman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on July 20, 1953, and grew up in the middle-class Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park. He is the son of Harold and Margaret Friedman. He has two older sisters, Shelley and Jane.<br /><br />In January 1995, Friedman took over the <i>New York Times Foreign</i> Affairs column. \u201cIt was the job I had always aspired to,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had loved reading columns and op-ed articles ever since I was in high school, when I used to wait around for the afternoon paper, the Minneapolis Star, to be delivered. It carried Peter Lisagor. He was a favorite columnist of mine. I used to grab the paper from the front step and read it on the living room floor.\u201d<br /><br />Friedman has been the <i>Times</i>\u2018s Foreign Affairs columnist since 1995, traveling extensively in an effort to anchor his opinions in reporting on the ground. \u201cI am a big believer in the saying \u2018If you don\u2019t go, you don\u2019t know.\u2019 I tried to do two things with the column when I took it over. First was to broaden the definition of foreign affairs and explore the impacts on international relations of finance, globalization, environmentalism, biodiversity, and technology, as well as covering conventional issues like conflict, traditional diplomacy, and arms control. Second, I tried to write in a way that would be accessible to the general reader and bring a broader audience into the foreign policy conversation\u2014beyond the usual State Department policy wonks. It was somewhat controversial at the time. So, I eventually decided to write a book that would explain the framework through which I was looking at the world. It was a framework that basically said if you want to understand the world today, you have to see it as a constant tension between what was very old in shaping international relations (the passions of nationalism, ethnicity, religion, geography, and culture) and what was very new (technology, the Internet, and the globalization of markets and finance). If you try to see the world from just one of those angles, it won\u2019t make sense. It is all about the intersection of the two.\u201d",

        "biography": "<b>Charles John Huffam Dickens</b> was a writer and social critic who created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.<br /><br />Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.<br /><br />Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers\u2014from Leo Tolstoy to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3706.George_Orwell\" title=\"George Orwell\" rel=\"nofollow\">George Orwell</a> and G. K. Chesterton\u2014for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<br /><br />On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on <i>Edwin Drood.</i> He never regained consciousness, and the next day he died at Gad's Hill Place. Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner,\" he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads: \"To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.\" His last words were: \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.<br /><br />(from Wikipedia)",

        "biography": "My journey to becoming an author has been a roundabout one, taking in many other careers. I grew up on the edge of Epping Forest and was that dreamy kind of child who was always writing stories. After reading English at Cambridge, I decided to find out as much as I could about the wider world so joined the Foreign Office and served in Poland. My work as a diplomat took me from the high point of town twinning in the Tatra Mountains to the low of inspecting the bottom of a Silesian coal mine.<br /><br />On leaving Poland, I exchanged diplomacy for academia and took a doctorate in the literature of the English Romantic Period at Oxford. I then joined Oxfam as a lobbyist on conflict issues, campaigning at the UN and with governments to lessen the impact of conflict on civilians living in war zones - a cause about which I still feel very passionate.<br /><br />Married with three children, I now live in Oxford between two rivers, surrounded by gargoyles, beautiful sandstone buildings and ancient trees.<br /><br />My first novel, 'The Diamond of Drury Lane', won the Waterstone's Children's Book Prize 2006 and the Nestle Children's Book Prize 2006 (formerly known as the Smarties Prize). I was also chosen by Waterstone's in 2007 as one of their 'Twenty-five authors for the future'. In the US, 'Secret of the Sirens' won the honor book medal of the Green Earth Book Award. <br /><br />My latest series, which starts with Mel Foster and the Demon Butler, about an intrepid Victorian orphan who lives in a household of monsters, won Bronze in the Primary Teacher awards in 2015. The next part, Mel Foster and the Time Machine, has set the time-dial to arrive in 2016.",

        "biography": "British comedian Hugh Laurie, OBE could have easily taken another career track rather than that of well-known performer. As a secondary and college student, he was also a world-class oarsman. He wasn't the only one in the family to have a passion for the sport, however. His father won a gold medal at the 1948 London Olympics as part of the British national team. The youngest of four children, Laurie went to Eton College, perhaps Britain's best-known preparatory school. During his time there, he became involved in rowing. He quickly became one of the nation's best, and in 1977, he became one half of the national junior champion coxed pair. In the world junior championships held in Finland that year, he and his teammate finished fourth in the world.<br /><br />The following year, Laurie entered Cambridge University, with the intention of studying archeology and anthropology. He was also intent on joining the prestigious rowing team, rowing in the 1980 Cambridge/Oxford boatrace. More information on the race can be found at BBC Sport<br /><br />He reportedly became ill during his first year, however, and was forced to withdraw from the rowing competitions. While regaining his health, Laurie had his first experiences as a performer by getting involved with the Footlights Club, a famed undergraduate comedy revue group. In his last year at Cambridge, Laurie was elected President of the club, with fellow Footlighter Emma Thompson acting as Vice President.<br /><br />Traditionally, at the end of the year, the Footlights take their act on the road throughout the nation. While on these tours, he met, via Thompson, a young playwright named Stephen Fry . They collaborated on a sketch called The Cellar Tapes , which they entered in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1981. They were awarded \"Pick of the Fringe,\" enabling the duo, along with the other Footlight performers (including Thompson) to go on tour through England and eventually, Australia.<br /><br />Soon thereafter, Laurie, Fry, Thompson, Robbie Coltrane , and Ben Elton formed the television sketch program Alfresco , eventually leading Laurie to the famous (in Britain, at least) Black Adder series, headed by Rowan Atkinson , and also to the Jeeves and Wooster series with Fry.<br /><br />It wasn't long after these successes that he began appearing in films. In 1992, he appeared alongside fellow comedians Fry and Thompson, as well as Kenneth Branagh and Rita Rudner in the ensemble comedy Peter's Friends<br /><br />He subsequently did outstanding work as a character actor in such films as Sense and Sensibility (1995) and 101 Dalmations (1996). In 1999, he took the lead in the adaptation of E.B. White's <i>Stuart Little</i>, playing the adopted father to a walking, talking, fully dressed mouse, a role he'd reprise in the film's 2002 sequel <i>Stuart Little 2</i>.<br /><br />After a two year absence from the big-screen, Laurie returned to the multiplexes in 2004 with a supporting role in <i>Flight of the Phoenix</i>, a remake of the 1965 James Stewart action-adventure film about a group of plane-crash survivors who attempt to build a new plane from the wreckage. That same year Laurie essayed the titular role as the cynical but trailblazing Dr. Greg House in the primetime Fox Network television drama <i>House</i> .<br /><br />Laurie is also a musician of note, invariably performing as a keyboardist with the rock band Poor White Trash and the Little Big Horns. He currently plays keyboards with Band From TV - a band featuring other television stars who perform to raise money for various charities. He added yet another profession to his lengthy list of accomplishments when, in 1996, he published his first novel, The Gun Seller. Married since 1989, he has three children with his wife, Jo.",

        "biography": "Anna Sewell was a kind and generous woman whose great love for horses and desire to see them better treated resulted in the most celebrated animal story of the nineteenth century. <br /><br />Born into a strict Quaker family who lived at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, she was brought up to believe in the importance of self-reliance, moral responsibility and 'tender consideration for the Creatures of God'. From an early age she developed a strong love of animals and abhorred any form of cruelty towards them. She seemed to have a natural affinity with horses, and the great knowledge of horsemanship evident in <i> Black Beauty </i> was born from a lifetime's experience. Anna received her education at home from her mother, who as well as instilling in her a sense of duty and religion also filled the house with music, painting and poetry - she was herself an accomplished ballad-writer - and Anna soon proved a capable pianist and artist. When she was fourteen, Anna - who already suffered from a crippling bone disease - had a fall which left her an invalid for the rest of her life. By her mid-thirties she was no longer able to get around by herself and relied on a pony cart to transport her. Characteristically she never used a whip on her own horses, and one of her intentions with <i> Black Beauty </i> was to 'induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses'.<br /><br />Confined to her room through ill-health, Anna started writing <i> Black Beauty </i> in 1871 but later abandoned the project until 1876. Afraid that she would not live to see the book published she worked laboriously on it despite failing health. Her mother found a publisher for the book and a delighted Anna saw her work in print in November 1877. She died five months later and was buried at the family plot near Old Catton in Norfolk. What Anna did not live to see was the effect her 'little book' has had on the millions of people around the world who have read it. It has been translated into many languages and there have been several attempts at filming it. As Anna hoped, <i> Black Beauty </i> has exercised great influence on the treatment of animals, a fact highlighted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) recommendation of the book.<br /><br /><br />See Also:<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Sewell\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Sewell</a>",

        "biography": "Raymond Thornton Chandler was an American novelist and screenwriter.<br /><br />In 1932, at age forty-four, Raymond Chandler decided to become a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Depression. His first short story, \"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\", was published in 1933 in Black Mask, a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, <i>The Big Sleep</i>, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published just seven full novels during his lifetime (though an eighth in progress at his death was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but <i>Playback</i> have been realized into motion pictures, some several times. In the year before he died, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. He died on March 26, 1959, in La Jolla, California.<br /><br />Chandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature, and is considered by many to be a founder, along with Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain and other Black Mask writers, of the hard-boiled school of detective fiction. Chandler's Philip Marlowe, along with Hammett's Sam Spade, are considered by some to be synonymous with \"private detective,\" both having been played on screen by Humphrey Bogart, whom many considered to be the quintessential Marlowe.<br /><br />Some of Chandler's novels are considered to be important literary works, and three are often considered to be masterpieces: <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i> (1940), <i>The Little Sister</i> (1949), and <i>The Long Goodbye</i> (1953). <i>The Long Goodbye</i> is praised within an anthology of American crime stories as \"arguably the first book since Hammett's <i>The Glass Key</i>, published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery\".",

He started his career in 1963 as an animator at the studio Toei Douga, and was subsequently involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he commanded attention with his incredible ability to draw, and the seemingly-endless stream of movie ideas he proposed.<br /><br />In 1971, he moved to A Pro with Isao Takahata, then to Nippon Animation in 1973, where he was heavily involved in the World Masterpiece Theater TV animation series for the next five years. In 1978, he directed his first TV series, <i>Conan, The Boy in Future</i>, then moved to Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first movie, the classic <i>Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro</i>.<br /><br />In 1984, he released <i>Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind</i>, based on the manga (comic) of the same title which he had started two years before. The success of the film led to the establishment of a new animation studio, Studio Ghibli, at which Miyazaki has since written, directed, and produced many other films with Takahata. All of these films enjoyed critical and box office successes. In particular, Miyazaki's <i>Princess Mononoke</i> received the Japan Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about US$150 million) domestic film in Japan's history until it was taken over by another Miyazaki work, <i>Spirited Away</i>.<br /><br />In addition to animation, Miyazaki also draws manga. His major work was the <i>Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind</i> manga, an epic tale he worked on intermittently from 1982 to 1994 while he was busy making animated films. Another manga, <i>Hikoutei Jidai</i>, was later evolved into his film <i>Porco Rosso</i>.",

        "biography": "Douglas Richard Hofstadter is an American academic whose research focuses on consciousness, thinking and creativity. He is best known for his <i>book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i>, first published in 1979, for which he was awarded the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction.<br /><br />Hofstadter is the son of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter. Douglas grew up on the campus of Stanford University, where his father was a professor. Douglas attended the International School of Geneva for a year. He graduated with Distinction in Mathematics from Stanford in 1965. He spent a few years in Sweden in the mid 1960s. He continued his education and received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Oregon in 1975.<br /><br />Hofstadter is College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the \"Fluid Analogies Research Group\" (FARG). He was initially appointed to the Indiana University's Computer Science Department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which at that time he called \"artificial intelligence research\", a label that he has since dropped in favor of \"cognitive science research\"). In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding. In 1988 he returned to Bloomington as \"College of Arts and Sciences Professor\" in both Cognitive Science and Computer Science, and also was appointed Adjunct Professor of History and Philosophy of Science, Philosophy, Comparative Literature, and Psychology, but he states that his involvement with most of these departments is nominal. <br /><br />In April, 2009, Hofstadter was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Member of the American Philosophical Society.<br />Hofstadter's many interests include music, visual art, the mind, creativity, consciousness, self-reference, translation and mathematics. He has numerous recursive sequences and geometric constructions named after him.<br /><br />At the University of Michigan and Indiana University, he co-authored, with Melanie Mitchell, a computational model of \"high-level perception\" \u2014 Copycat \u2014 and several other models of analogy-making and cognition. The Copycat project was subsequently extended under the name \"Metacat\" by Hofstadter's doctoral student James Marshall. The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model the act of artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform \"gridfonts\" (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models are Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of Bongard problems and number sequences, respectively.<br /><br />Hofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), \"bon mots\" (spontaneous humorous quips), and analogies of all sorts, and his long-time observation of these diverse products of cognition, and his theories about the mechanisms that underlie them, have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models developed by himself and FARG members.<br /><br />All FARG computational models share certain key principles, among which are: that human thinking is carried out by thousands of independent small actions in parallel, biased by the concepts that are currently activated; that activation spreads from activated concepts to less activated \"neighbor concepts\"; that there is a \"mental temperature\" that regulates the degree of randomness in the parallel activity; that promising avenues tend to be explored more rapidly than unpromising ones. FARG models also have an overarching philosophy that",

        "biography": "Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England. His parents' house was in north London, but during the second world war Oxford was considered a safer place to have babies. When he was eight, his family moved to St Albans, a town about 20 miles north of London. At eleven Stephen went to St Albans School, and then on to University College, Oxford, his father's old college. Stephen wanted to do Mathematics, although his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College, so he did Physics instead. After three years and not very much work he was awarded a first class honours degree in Natural Science.<br /><br />Stephen then went on to Cambridge to do research in Cosmology, there being no-one working in that area in Oxford at the time. His supervisor was Denis Sciama, although he had hoped to get Fred Hoyle who was working in Cambridge. After gaining his Ph.D. he became first a Research Fellow, and later on a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. After leaving the Institute of Astronomy in 1973 Stephen came to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, and since 1979 has held the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. The chair was founded in 1663 with money left in the will of the Reverend Henry Lucas, who had been the Member of Parliament for the University. It was first held by Isaac Barrow, and then in 1669 by Isaac Newton.<br /><br />Stephen Hawking worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose he showed that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity implied space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. These results indicated it was necessary to unify General Relativity with Quantum Theory, the other great Scientific development of the first half of the 20th Century. One consequence of such a unification that he discovered was that black holes should not be completely black, but should emit radiation and eventually evaporate and disappear. Another conjecture is that the universe has no edge or boundary in imaginary time. This would imply that the way the universe began was completely determined by the laws of science.<br /><br />His many publications include The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime with G.F.R. Ellis, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey, with W. Israel, and 300 Years of Gravity, with W. Israel. Stephen Hawking has three popular books published; his best seller A Brief History of Time, Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays and most recently in 2001, The Universe in a Nutshell. <br /><br />Professor Hawking received twelve honorary degrees, was awarded the CBE in 1982, and was made a Companion of Honour in 1989. He was the recipient of many awards, medals and prizes and is a Fellow of The Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.",

His father, who spent more than a year in the Buchenwald death camp, had been a leader in the Jewish resistance under Nazi rule in his hometown of Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland. As a child, Mlodinow was interested in both mathematics and chemistry, and while in high school was tutored in organic chemistry by a professor from the University of Illinois.<br /><br />As recounted in his book, <i>Feynman's Rainbow</i>, his interest turned to physics during a semester he took off from college to spend on a kibbutz in Israel, during which he had little to do at night beside reading <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>, which was one of the few English books he found in the kibbutz library.<br /><br />While a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, and on the faculty at Caltech, he developed (with N. Papanicolaou) a new type of perturbation theory for eigenvalue problems in quantum mechanics. Later, as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysik in Munich, Germany, he did pioneering work (with M. Hillery) on the quantum theory of dielectric media.<br /><br />Apart from his research and books on popular science, he also wrote the screenplay for the film <i>Beyond the Horizon</i> (currently in production) and has been a screenwriter for television series, including <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> and <i>MacGyver.</i> He co-authored (with Matt Costello) a children's chapter book series entitled <i>The Kids of Einstein Elementary.</i><br /><br />Between 2008 and 2010, Mlodinow worked on a book with Stephen Hawking, entitled <i>The Grand Design.</i> A step beyond Hawking's other titles, The Grand Design is said to explore both the question of the existence of the universe and the issue of why the laws of physics are what they are.<br /><br />Mlodinow currently teaches at Caltech and is in discussions about producing a book with the controversial spiritualist Deepak Chopra.",

Several of his novels are set in a fictional northern New Jersey city called Dempsy. In his review of Lush Life (2008), Walter Kirn compared Price to Raymond Chandler and Saul Bellow.<br /><br />Price's first novel was The Wanderers (1974), a coming-of-age story set in the Bronx in 1962, written when Price was 24 years old. It was adapted into a movie in 1979, with a screenplay by Rose and Philip Kaufman and directed by the latter.<br />Clockers (1992) was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award. It has been praised for its humor, suspense, dialogue, and characterizations. In 1995, it was made into a movie directed by Spike Lee; Price and Lee shared writing credits for the screenplay.<br /><br />Price has written numerous screenplays, of which the best known are The Color of Money (1986), for which he was nominated for an Oscar, Life Lessons (the Martin Scorsese segment of New York Stories) (1989), Sea of Love (1989), Mad Dog and Glory (1992), Ransom (1996), and Shaft (2000). He also wrote for the HBO series The Wire. Price was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the fifth season of The Wire. He is often cast in cameo roles in the films he writes.<br /><br />Price also wrote and conceptualized the 15 minute film surrounding Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" video.<br />Additionally, he has published articles in the The New York Times, Esquire Magazine, The New Yorker, Village Voice, Rolling Stone, and others.",

        "biography": "Prof. Lawrence M. Krauss is an internationally known theoretical physicist with wide research interests, including the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, where his studies include the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics. He has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. He was born in New York City and moved shortly thereafter to Toronto, Canada, where he grew up. He received undergraduate degrees in both Mathematics and Physics at Carleton University. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1982), then joined the Harvard Society of Fellows (1982-85). He joined the faculty of the departments of Physics and Astronomy at Yale University as assistant professor in 1985, and associate professor in 1988. In 1993 he was named the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics, Professor of Astronomy, and Chairman of the department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University. He served in the latter position for 12 years, until 2005. During this period he built up the department, which was ranked among the top 20 Physics Graduate Research Programs in the country in a 2005 national ranking. Among the major new initiatives he spearheaded are included the creation of one of the top particle astrophysics experimental and theoretical programs in the US, and the creation of a groundbreaking Masters Program in Physics Entrepreneurship. In 2002, he was named Director of the Center for Education and Research in Cosmology and Astrophysics at Case.<br /><br />In August 2008 Krauss took up his new post as Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and Physics Department, and Inaugural Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University . As planned, Origins will become a national center for research and outreach on origins issues, from the origins of the universe, to human origins, to the origins of consciousness and culture. It will also form a cross-cutting educational theme at ASU. In April of 2009, it hosted an Origins Symposium, bringing together some of the most well known scientists and public intellectuals in the world for both scientific discussions and public presentations. Over 5000 people attended the events directly, and many more watched the live webcasts from around the world.<br /><br />Prof. Krauss is the author of over 300 scientific publications, as well as numerous popular articles on physics and astronomy. He is the recipient of numerous awards for his research and writing, including the Gravity Research Foundation First Prize Award (1984), and the Presidential Investigator Award (1986). In February 2000, in Washington D.C., Krauss was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science's 1999-2000 Award for the Public Understanding of Science and Technology . Previous awardees include Carl Sagan (1995) and E.O. Wilson (1994). In 2001 he was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society . The citation reads \"For outstanding contributions to the understanding of the early universe, and extraordinary achievement in communicating the essence of physical science to the general public\". Previous awardees include Stephen W. Hawking (1999), and Kip S. Thorne (1996). In 2001 the American Institute of Physics awarded Krauss the Andrew Gemant Award , given annually to \"a person who has made significant contributions to the cultural, artistic, or humanistic dimensions of physics\". Previous awardees include Freeman Dyson, Steven Weinberg, and Stephen Hawking. He was also awarded the American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award in 2002 for his book \"Atom\".<br /><br />continue reading<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/biography/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/biography/</a>",

The topical range of his prolific writings includes quantum physics, biographies of famous scientists, human evolution, the origins of the universe, climate change and global warming. His also writes science fiction.<br /><br />John Gribbin graduated with his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Sussex in 1966. Gribbin then earned his master of science (M.Sc.) degree in astronomy in 1967, also from the Univ. of Sussex, and he earned his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Cambridge (1971).<br /><br />In 1968, Gribbin worked as one of Fred Hoyle's research students at the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, and wrote a number of stories for New Scientist about the Institute's research and what were eventually discovered to be pulsars.<br /><br />In 1974, Gribbin published, along with Stephen Plagemann, a book titled The Jupiter Effect, that predicted that the alignment of the planets in quadrant on one side of the Sun on March 10, 1982 would cause gravitational effects that would trigger earthquakes in the San Andreas fault, possibly wiping out Los Angeles and its suburbs. Gribbin repudiated The Jupiter Effect in the July 17, 1980, issue of New Scientist magazine in which he stated that he had been \"too clever by half\".<br /><br />In 1984, Gribbin published In Search of Schrodinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality, the book that he is best known for, which continues to sell well 28 years after publication. It has been described as among the best of the first wave of physics popularisations preceding Stephen Hawking's multi-million-selling A Brief History of Time. Gribbin's book has been cited as an example of how to revive an interest in the study of mathematics.<br /><br />In 2006, Gribbin took part in a BBC radio 4 broadcast as an \"expert witness\". Presenter Matthew Parris discussed with Professor Kathy Sykes and Gribbin whether Einstein \"really was a 'crazy genius' \".<br /><br />At the 2009 World Conference of Science Journalists, the Association of British Science Writers presented Gribbin with their Lifetime Achievement award.",

With an early interest in religion and a deeply felt connection to spirituality, Neale spent the majority of his life thriving professionally, yet searching for spiritual meaning before beginning his now famous conversation with God. His With God series of books has been translated into 34 languages, touching millions of lives and inspiring important changes in their day-to-day lives.<br /><br />In addition to authoring the renowned With God series, Neale has published 16 other works, as well as a number of video and audio programs. Available throughout the world, each of the CwG dialogue books has made the New York Times Bestseller list, Conversations with God-Book 1 occupying that list for over two and half years.<br /><br />The With God Series has redefined God and shifted spiritual paradigms around the globe. In order to deal with the enormous response to his writings, Neale created the Conversations with God Foundation, a non-profit educational organization dedicated to inspiring the world to help itself move from violence to peace, from confusion to clarity, and from anger to love.<br /><br />Neale's work has taken him from the steps of Macchu Picchu in Peru to the steps of the Shinto shrines of Japan, from Red Square in Moscow to St. Peters Square in Vatican City to Tiananmen Square in China. And everywhere he has gone-from South Africa to Norway, Croatia to The Netherlands, the streets of Zurich to the streets of Seoul, Neale has found a hunger among the people to find a new way to live, at last, in peace and harmony, and he has sought to bring people a new understanding of life and of God which would allow them to experience that.\"",

In 1979 Hartmann and his wife Louise founded <a href=\"http://www.salemchildrensvillage.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">New England Salem Children's Village </a> whose main purpose is to provide a home and a nurturing environment for neglected and emotionally disturbed children and New England Salem Childrens Trust (NESCT). Hartmann served as NESCT's Executive Director for five years, and on its board for over 25 years. Through his affliiation with German Salem International organization and with that group he helped start international relief programs in Uganda, Colombia, Russia, Israel, India, Australia, and several other countries between 1979 and today.<br /><br /><br />Thom Hartmann introduced the theory of hunters and farmers in his groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278998.Attention_Deficit_Disorder_A_Different_Perception\" title=\"Attention Deficit Disorder A Different Perception by Thom Hartmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception</a>. In the book, Thom hypothesized that traits that were advantageous in a hunting culture - being alert to every sound in the environment, willingness to take risks, etc - became not so helpful when society switched to farming, and the prized trait was the ability to stick patiently to a task. <br /><br />The hunters and farmers theory of ADHD children is the idea that they are the \"hunters\" who are able to take in continuous stimuli and react quickly to changing circumstances. Whereas, non-ADHD children are the \"farmers\" who are patient, methodical, and focused over long periods of time. Unfortunately for ADHD children, traditional schools teach for the patient \"farmers\", and not the alert and quick reacting \"hunters.\"<br /><br />In 1998 the New England Salem Children's Trust established The Hunter School and began to serve children who struggle in traditional education settings because of the educational and behavioral differences associated with ADHD. <a href=\"http://www.hunterschool.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter School</a>, the Hunter School is a small, non-profit residential and day school where young boys and girls with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Asperger's Syndrome are nurtured, educated and celebrated. <br /><br />As an entrepreneur, Hartmann's also founded several successful businesses including Woodley Herber Company which operated until 1978. In 1983 he founded International Wholesale Travel and its retail subsidiary Sprayberry Travel and the Atlanta advertising agency Chandler, MacDonald, Stout, Schneiderman &amp; Poe, Inc., which did business as The Newsletter Factory. <br /><br />He sold his interest in that company in 1996 and retired to Vermont, although he and Louise now live in Washington D.C., complete with a radio studio and their mascot attack-cat, Higgins.<br /><br />",

        "biography": "Walter Whitman was an American poet, essayist, journalist, and humanist. He was a part of the transition between Transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse.<br /><br />Born on Long Island, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War in addition to publishing his poetry. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842).<br /><br />After working as clerk, teacher, journalist and laborer, Whitman wrote his masterpiece, Leaves of Grass, pioneering free verse poetry in a humanistic celebration of humanity, in 1855. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12080.Emerson\" title=\"Emerson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerson</a>, whom Whitman revered, said of Leaves of Grass that it held \"incomparable things incomparably said.\" During the Civil War, Whitman worked as an army nurse, later writing Drum Taps (1865) and Memoranda During the War (1867). His health compromised by the experience, he was given work at the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. After a stroke in 1873, which left him partially paralyzed, Whitman lived his next 20 years with his brother, writing mainly prose, such as Democratic Vistas (1870). Leaves of Grass was published in nine editions, with Whitman elaborating on it in each successive edition. In 1881, the book had the compliment of being banned by the commonwealth of Massachusetts on charges of immorality. A good friend of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/156323.Robert_Ingersoll\" title=\"Robert Ingersoll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Ingersoll</a>, Whitman was at most a Deist who scorned religion.

        "biography": "I was born in Bloomington, Indiana. I was due on Valentine's Day but arrived a week early; my mother blamed this on a really exciting IU basketball game. My father was a psychologist at the University, but not that kind of psychologist. He studied animal behavior, and especially learning. He ran rats through mazes. My mother was a polio survivor, a schoolteacher, and a pioneer in the co-operative nursery school movement. Along with basketball, my family loved books. The day I got my first library card there was a special dinner to celebrate. And before I could read myself, I remember my father reading The Iliad to me, although really he was reading it to my older brother, I just got to be there. A shocking book! And I remember Mary Poppins and Winnie the Pooh in my father's voice and a bunch of other things that weren't movies yet. My parents strongly disapproved of the Disney version of things. Pooh believed in a spoonful of honey, but Mary Poppins did not.<br /><br />I have great memories of Bloomington. Our block was packed with kids and we played enormous games that covered whole blocks of territory, with ten kids to a side. One of my childhood friends was Theodore Deppe, who's now an outstanding poet. I planned to grow up to be a dog trainer myself.<br /><br />Both my parents were raised in southern California and so regarded our time in Indiana as an exile. When I was 11 years old my father was offered a job with Encyclopedia Britannica that necessitated our moving to Palo Alto, California. My parents were thrilled to be coming back. My older brother, for reasons that escape me, was equally pleased. I was devastated.<br /><br />Palo Alto was much more sophisticated than Bloomington. At recess in Bloomington we played baseball, skipped rope, played jacks or marbles depending on the season. In Palo Alto girls my age were already setting their hair, listening to the radio, talking about boys. I considered it a sad trade. The best thing about the sixth-grade was that my teacher, Miss Sarzin, read The Hobbit to us.<br /><br />After reading many more books, I graduated from Palo Alto High in 1968 and went to Berkeley. I was a political science major and an antiwar activist. I was in Berkeley during People's Park, when the city was occupied and there were tanks on the street corners, and I was there during the Jackson State/Kent State killings. I met my husband there. He'd been part of the free speech movement; that was my idea of glamor. We got married the year I graduated and we came to graduate school at UC Davis together.<br /><br />As an undergraduate I had a special interest in India and Gandhi, and a general interest in imperialism. I find the intersection of cultures fascinating, the misunderstandings that occur, the mistakes that are innocently made. I'm not so fascinated by the mistakes that aren't innocent, although there are a good many more of the latter kind. As a graduate student I focused on China and Japan. It's not clear to me what my career goals were \u2014 whatever, I had my first child during spring break of the last year of my masters. Six days less than two years later I had a second child. My husband and I still live in Davis, although the kids have left for college and beyond.<br /><br />I decided to try to be a writer on my 30th birthday.<br />All questions answered",

        "biography": "John Andrew Sutherland is an English lecturer, emeritus professor, newspaper columnist and author.<br /><br />Now Emeritus Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London, John Sutherland began his academic career after graduating from the University of Leicester as an assistant lecturer in Edinburgh in 1964. He specialises in Victorian fiction, 20th century literature, and the history of publishing.<br /><br />Apart from writing a regular column in the <i>The Guardian newspaper</i>, Sutherland has published seventeen (as of 2004) books and is editing the forthcoming Oxford Companion to Popular Fiction. The series of books which starts with <i>Was Heathcliff a Murderer?</i> has brought him a wide readership. The books in the series are collections of essays. Each essay takes a piece of classic fiction, almost always from the Victorian period. Carefully going over every word of the text, Sutherland highlights apparent inconsistencies, anachronisms and oversights, and explains references which the modern reader is likely to overlook. In some cases he demonstrates the likelihood that the author simply forgot a minor detail. In others, apparent slips on the part of the author are presented as evidence that something is going on beyond the surface of the book which is not explicitly described (such as his explanation for why Sherlock Holmes should mis-address Miss Stoner as Miss Roylott in \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\").<br /><br />In 2001, he published <i>Last Drink to LA</i>, a moving chronicle of his alcoholism and his return to sobriety.<br /><br />In 2005, he was involved in Dot Mobile's project to translate summaries and quotes of classic literature into text messaging shorthand. In the same year he was also Chair of Judges for the Booker Prize.<br /><br />In June 2007 he published an autobiography: <i>The Boy Who Loved Books: A Memoir</i>. On 18 December 2007 his annotated edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>The Black Arrow</i> was released by Penguin Books.<br />",

        "biography": "Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American author and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections and two non-fiction works. Three novels, four collections of short stories and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of these are considered classics of American literature.<br /><br />Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school he reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms. In 1922, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent, and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s \"Lost Generation\" expatriate community. The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway's first novel, was published in 1926.<br /><br />After his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer. They divorced after he returned from Spanish Civil War where he had acted as a journalist, and after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls. Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940. They separated when he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II; during which he was present at the Normandy Landings and liberation of Paris.<br /><br />Shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea in 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two plane crashes that left him in pain or ill-health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during the 1930s and 1940s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.",

        "biography": "Ferdinand Victor Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.<br /><br />In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \"forces of the sublime\", of nature in often violent action.<br /><br />However, Delacroix was given neither to sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\"<br />",

        "biography": "Amantine Aurore Lucile Dupin, later Baroness (French:baronne) Dudevant (1 July 1804 \u2013 8 June 1876), best known by her pseudonym George Sand, was a French novelist. She is considered by some a feminist although she refused to join this movement. She is regarded as the first French female novelist to gain a major reputation.<br /><br />Sand's reputation came into question when she began sporting men's clothing in public \u2014 which she justified by the clothes being far sturdier and less expensive than the typical dress of a noblewoman at the time. In addition to being comfortable, Sand's male dress enabled her to circulate more freely in Paris than most of her female contemporaries could, and gave her increased access to venues from which women were often barred \u2014 even women of her social standing.<br /><br />Also scandalous was Sand's smoking tobacco in public; neither peerage nor gentry had yet sanctioned the free indulgence of women in such a habit, especially in public (though Franz Liszt's paramour Marie D'Agoult affected this as well, smoking large cigars). These and other behaviors were exceptional for a woman of the early and mid-19th century, when social codes\u2014especially in the upper classes\u2014were of the utmost importance.<br /><br />As a consequence of many unorthodox aspects of her lifestyle, Sand was obliged to relinquish some of the privileges appertaining to a baroness \u2014 though, interestingly, the mores of the period did permit upper-class wives to live physically separated from their husbands, without losing face, provided the estranged couple exhibited no blatant irregularity to the outside world.<br /><br />Poet Charles Baudelaire was a contemporary critic of George Sand: \"She is stupid, heavy and garrulous. Her ideas on morals have the same depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women.... The fact that there are men who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation.\"<br /><br />However, other luminaries in the world of arts and letters did not necessarily agree with Baudelaire, a few quotes will suffice:<br /><br />\"She was a thinking bosom and one who overpowered her young lovers, all Sybil \u2014 a Romantic.\" <br />V.S. Pritchett (writer) <br /><br />\"What a brave man she was, and what a good woman.\" <br />Ivan Turgenev (novelist) <br /><br />\"The most womanly woman.\" <br />Alfred de Musset (poet) <br /><br />George Sand died at Nohant, near Ch\u00e2teauroux, in France's Indre d\u00e9partement on 8 June 1876, at the age of 71 and was buried in the grounds of her home there.",

He attended Grosse Pointe's private University Liggett School. He took his undergraduate degree at Brown University, graduating in 1983. He later earned an M.A. in Creative Writing from Stanford University.<br /><br />In 1986 he received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Nicholl Fellowship for his story \"Here Comes Winston, Full of the Holy Spirit\". His 1993 novel, The Virgin Suicides, gained mainstream interest with the 1999 film adaptation directed by Sofia Coppola. The novel was reissued in 2009.<br /><br />Eugenides is reluctant to appear in public or disclose details about his private life, except through Michigan-area book signings in which he details the influence of Detroit and his high-school experiences on his writings. He has said that he has been haunted by the decline of Detroit.<br /><br />Jeffrey Eugenides lives in Princeton, New Jersey with his wife, the photographer and sculptor Karen Yamauchi, and their daughter. In the fall of 2007, Eugenides joined the faculty of Princeton University's Program in Creative Writing.<br /><br />His 2002 novel, Middlesex, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the Ambassador Book Award. Part of it was set in Berlin, Germany, where Eugenides lived from 1999 to 2004, but it was chiefly concerned with the Greek-American immigrant experience in the United States, against the rise and fall of Detroit. It explores the experience of the intersexed in the USA. Eugenides has also published short stories.<br /><br />Eugenides is the editor of the collection of short stories titled My Mistress's Sparrow is Dead. The proceeds of the collection go to the writing center 826 Chicago, established to encourage young people's writing.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/jeffreyeugenides\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/author/jeffre...</a><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Authors/7682/jeffrey-eugenides\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Author...</a>",

This is John^^Adams.</i><br /><br />An American Founding Father, the second president of the United States (1797\u20131801), having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States (1789\u20131797).<br /><br />Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution. A cousin of revolutionary leader Samuel Adams, John Adams was a lawyer and public figure in Boston. As a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress, Adams played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence. He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and was its primary advocate in the Congress. <br /><br />Later, as a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain, and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers. <br /><br />A political theorist and historian, Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government, influenced American political thought. <br /><br />One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character: in 1775, he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief, and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States.<br /><br />Adams' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president. During his one term as president, he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans, as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war (called the \"Quasi-War\") with France, 1798\u20131800. <br /><br />The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. Because he promoted a strong defense, Adams is \"often called the father of the American Navy\".<br /><br />In 1800, Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts. He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson. He and his wife founded an accomplished family line of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family. <br /><br />Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders. Adams was the first U.S. president to reside in the executive mansion that eventually became known as the White House.<br /><br />Well educated, he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism, as well as a strong central government, and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas\u2014both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail Adams.",

        "biography": "More than a mere renaissance man, Jefferson may actually have been a new kind of man. He was fluent in five languages and able to read two others. He wrote, over the course of his life, over sixteen thousand letters. He was acquainted with nearly every influential person in America, and a great many in Europe as well. He was a lawyer, agronomist, musician, scientist, philosopher, author, architect, inventor, and statesman. Though he never set foot outside of the American continent before adulthood, he acquired an education that rivaled the finest to be attained in Europe. He was clearly the foremost American son of the Enlightenment.<br /><br />Jefferson was born at Shadwell in Albemarle county, Virginia on April 13, 1743. He was tutored by the Reverend James Maury, a learned man, in the finest classical tradition. He began the study of Latin, Greek, and French at the age of 9. He attended William and Mary College in Williamsburg at sixteen years old, then continued his education in the Law under George Wythe, the first professor of law in America (who later would sign Jefferson's Declaration in 1776). Thomas Jefferson attended the House of Burgesses as a student in 1765 when he witnessed Patrick Henry's defiant stand against the Stamp Act. He gained the Virginia bar and began practice in 1769, and was elected to the House of Burgesses in 1769. It was there that his involvement in revolutionary politics began. He was never a very vocal member, but his writing, his quiet work in committee, and his ability to distill large volumes of information to essence, made him an invaluable member in any deliberative body.<br /><br />In 1775 when a Virginia convention selected delegates to the Continental Congress, Jefferson was selected as an alternate. It was expected that Payton Randolph, (then Speaker of the Virginia House and president of the Continental Congress too,) would be recalled by the Royal Governor. This did happen and Jefferson went in his place. Thomas Jefferson had a theory about self governance and the rights of people who established habitat in new lands. Before attending the Congress in Philadelphia he codified these thoughts in an article called A Summary View of the Rights of British America. This paper he sent on ahead of him. He fell ill on the road and was delayed for several days. By the time he arrived, his paper had been published as a pamphlet and sent throughout the colonies and on to England where Edmund Burke, sympathetic to the colonial condition, had it reprinted and circulated widely. In 1776 Jefferson, then a member of the committee to draft a declaration of independence, was chosen by the committee to write the draft. This he did, with some minor corrections from James Madison and an embellishment from Franklin, the document was offered to the Congress on the first day of July. The congress modified it somewhat, abbreviating certain wording and removing points that were outside of general agreement. The Declaration was adopted on the Fourth of July.<br /><br />Jefferson returned to his home not long afterward. His wife and two of his children were very ill, he was tired of being remote from his home, and he was anxious about the development of a new government for his native state.<br /><br />In June of 1779 he succeeded Patrick Henry as Governor of Virginia. The nation was still at war, and the southern colonies were under heavy attack. Jefferson's Governorship was clouded with hesitation. He himself concluded that the state would be better served by a military man. He declined re-election after his first term and was succeeded by General Nelson of Yorktown.<br /><br />In 1781 he retired to Monticello, the estate he inherited, to write, work on improved agriculture, and attend his wife. It was during this time that he wrote Notes on the State of Virginia, a work that he never completed. Martha Jefferson died in September of 1782. This event threw Jefferson into a depression that, according to his eldest daughter he might never have recovere",

His father personally discipled Doug for much of his life, taking Doug with him around the country, such that Doug had traveled with his family through 49 of the 50 states by the time he was 18. His father \u2014 a former candidate for President of the United States who served as Acting Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity under Richard Nixon \u2014 faithfully read both Old and New Testament to him at the dinner table, taught him constitutional law, public policy, and communicated to Doug a remarkable passion for history. They listened together to more than 2,000 audiocassettes on history, books, and theology.<br /><br />As a young man, Doug was also discipled by Robert Gifford, a great preacher of the Word and pastor of Sovereign Grace Baptist Church, who communicated to Doug a passion for Christian apologetics and the sovereignty of God. Because of his father\u2019s work as a statesman, Doug had the opportunity to spend time with, and learn from, many of the great Christian leaders of the last 30 years. It was during this time, however, that Doug came to realize that the greatest witness a man could offer for Jesus Christ was not what he knew, but how he lived his life as a father and a husband. It was at this time that God began to build a vision in Doug\u2019s life for seeing the restoration of biblical manhood, godly femininity, and the Christian home.<br /><br />While running a Christian newspaper in college, Doug met Beall, a young woman who ran a ministry to unwed mothers called \u201cAlternatives to Abortion\u201d (interestingly enough, Beall herself had been adopted). Five years later, on \u201cthe happiest day of my life \u2014 except for every day after that,\u201d Doug and Beall were married. Doug attended law school for the purpose of developing skills that would help him defend home educators and Christian parents from State tyranny. He graduated from George Mason School of Law, where he studied under judges Robert Bork and Doug Ginsberg. He served for six years at the Home School Legal Defense Association in multiple capacities including staff attorney and Director of the National Center for Home Education.",

        "biography": "Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, M.D. was a Swiss-born psychiatrist, a pioneer in Near-death studies and the author of the groundbreaking book <i>On Death and Dying</i> (1969), where she first discussed what is now known as the K\u00fcbler-Ross model. In this work she proposed the now famous Five Stages of Grief as a pattern of adjustment. These five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages, though in no defined sequence, after being faced with the reality of their impending death. The five stages have since been adopted by many as applying to the survivors of a loved one\u2019s death, as well.<br /><br />She is a 2007 inductee into the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame. She was the recipient of twenty honorary degrees and by July 1982 had taught, in her estimation, 125,000 students in death and dying courses in colleges, seminaries, medical schools, hospitals, and social-work institutions. In 1970, she delivered the The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality at Harvard University, on the theme, On Death and Dying.",

        "biography": "New York Times bestselling author Martin Dugard is the co-author of Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy and Killing Jesus, written with noted television personality Bill O'Reilly. To date, there are more than seven million copies of these books in print. <br />Mr. Dugard is also the author of the critically lauded memoir To Be A Runner (Rodale, 2011), a series of essays which takes the reader around the world as he recounts his personal journey through the world of distance running. It is a book about life itself, and how the simple act of stepping outside for a run is a metaphor for our daily desire to be the best possible version of ourselves, step by step. <br />This attribute can be seen in the diversity and depth of Mr. Dugard's body of work. His ten years covering the Tour de France resulted in Chasing Lance (Little, Brown, 2005) a travelogue combining history, sports and gastronomy. Other works include the New York Times bestseller The Murder of King Tut (with James Patterson; Little, Brown, 2009); The Last Voyage of Columbus (Little, Brown, 2005), which tells the riveting tale of the legendary Admiral\u2019s final, ill-fated journey in crisp, swashbuckling fashion; Into Africa: The Epic Adventures of Stanley and Livingstone (Doubleday, 2003), Farther Than Any Man: The Rise and Fall of Captain James Cook (Pocket Books, 2001), Knockdown (Pocket Books, 1999), and Surviving the Toughest Race on Earth (McGraw-Hill, 1998). In addition, Dugard lived on the island of Pulau Tiga during the filming of Survivor's inaugural season to write the bestselling Survivor with mega-producer Mark Burnett. <br />Mr. Dugard is also the writer and producer of A WARRIOR'S HEART, starring Ashley Greene and Kellan Lutz, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2011. <br />An adventurer himself, Dugard regularly immerses himself in his research to understand characters and their motivations better. To better understand Columbus he traveled through Spain, the Caribbean and Central America. For Tut he explored pharaohs' tombs in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. He followed Henry Morton Stanley\u2019s path across Tanzania while researching Into Africa (managing to get thrown into an African prison in the process), and swam in the tiger shark-infested waters of Hawaii\u2019s Kealakekua Bay to recreate Captain James Cook\u2019s death for Farther Than Any Man. And for To Be A Runner he ran with the bulls in Pamplona, suffered electric shock and hypothermia as part of Britain's Tough Guy competition, and explored Japanese WWII bunkers on the island of Saipan. <br />On the more personal side of adventure, Dugard competed in the Raid Gauloises endurance race three times, and flew around the world at twice the speed of sound aboard an Air France Concorde. The time of 31 hours and 28 minutes set a world record for global circumnavigation. Dugard\u2019s magazine writing has appeared in Esquire, Outside, Sports Illustrated, and GQ, among others. In 1997, Dugard was awarded the Dallas Area Press Club\u2019s Katie Award for Best Magazine Sports Story. <br />Mr. Dugard spends his afternoons as the head cross country and track &amp; field coach at JSerra High School in San Juan Capistrano, California, a position he has held since 2005. His boys and girls squads regularly qualify for the California State Championships, and his girls team won the state title in 2010, 2011 and 2012.<br />Martin Dugard live in Orange County, California, with his wife and three sons.<br /><br />",

His first book was an adult-level biography of former basketball star Pistol Pete Maravich, and since then he has written children's and young adult biographies and profiles of many prominent sports stars such as Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Shaquille O'Neal, Ken Griffey, Jr., Bo Jackson, Brett Favre and many others. <br /><br />Some of his adult books include a biography of former football coach Bill Parcells, Parcells: A Biograpy; When the Cheering Stops, interviews with some 25 former baseball players from the 1940s through the 1960s on life after baseball; Won For All: The Inside Story of the New England Patriots' Improbable Run to the Super Bowl, written with former linebacker and then Patriots assistant coach Pepper Johnson; Twice Around the Bases, written with former big league manager Kevin Kennedy; The Giants Win the Pennant!

Of more recent vintage is What if the Babe Had Kept His Red Sox: And Other Fascinating Alternate Histories from the World of Sports, a book of What Ifs. His most recent sports book is a young adult biography of Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge called All Rise: The Aaron Judge Story.<br /><br />Bill's current passion is The Mike Fargo Mysteries, a series of novels and novellas about a tough detective working in the New York City of the 1920. The novel, Murder on Murderer's Row is available as both an ebook and in paperback on Amazon, an ebook on other venues. The novellas, Death of a Flapper, Murder on Broadway, Seven Days to Murder and The Grab-A-Cab Murder are currently available as ebooks. A sixth book, Roaring Twenties Cop, Mike Fargo's Own Story is told in Fargo's words and serves to bring the lead character of the series to life, as he talks about his childhood on Staten Island, the reason he became a cop, the New York City of the 1920s and some of his cases. The book serves as an introduction to the series and is available for free on the Amazon, Barnes and Noble, iBooks, Kobo and Smashwords websites. <br /><br />And hopefully there is much more to come.",

His parents divorced when he was four and he went to live with his mother's relatives in Monroeville, Alabama. He was a lonely child who learned to read and write by himself before entering school. In 1933, he moved to New York City to live with his mother and her new husband, Joseph Capote, a Cuban-born businessman. Mr. Capote adopted Truman, legally changing his last name to Capote and enrolling him in private school. After graduating from high school in 1942, Truman Capote began his regular job as a copy boy at <i>The New Yorker</i>. During this time, he also began his career as a writer, publishing many short stories which introduced him into a circle of literary critics. His first novel, <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i>, published in 1948, stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for nine weeks and became controversial because of the photograph of Capote used to promote the novel, posing seductively and gazing into the camera.<br /><br />In the 1950s and 1960s, Capote remained prolific producing both fiction and non-fiction. His masterpiece, <i>In Cold Blood</i>, a story about the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, was published in 1966 in book form by Random House, became a worldwide success and brought Capote much praise from the literary community. After this success he published rarely and suffered from alcohol addiction. He died in 1984 at age 59.",

She was the only child of Harry S. Truman (33rd President of the United States) and his wife Bess.<br /><br />Born in Independence, Missouri, she was christened Mary Margaret Truman (for her aunt Mary Jane Truman and her maternal grandmother Margaret Gates Wallace) but was called Margaret from early childhood.<br /><br />In 1944 Truman christened the battleship USS Missouri, which was named after her home state (when the ship was recommissioned in 1986 she was a featured speaker at the ceremony).<br /><br />Truman pursued a singing career in the late 1940s. After graduating from George Washington University and receiving some operatic vocal training, she debuted with the radio broadcast of a vocal recital in March 1947. After a performance in December 1950, Washington Post music critic Paul Hume wrote she was \u201cextremely attractive on the stage... [but] cannot sing very well. She is flat a good deal of the time.\u201d Her father, then President, wrote to Hume, \"I have never met you, but if I do you'll need a new nose and plenty of beefsteak and perhaps a supporter below.\" Years later she recalled, \u201cI thought it was funny. Sold tickets.\u201d[1] Truman's singing career was widely publicized during her father's presidency and the February 26, 1951 cover of Time Magazine carried her image with a single musical note floating by her head. She performed on stage, radio and television until the mid 1950s.<br /><br />Truman's place in pop culture was confirmed by her appearances as a Guest Panelist on the popular game show What's My Line?, replacing Dorothy Kilgallen several times and also appearing as a Mystery Guest.<br /><br />Truman married New York Times reporter (and later editor) Clifton Daniel (1912 - 2000) on April 21, 1956 at Trinity Episcopal Church in Independence, Missouri. They had four sons:<br /><br /> * Clifton Truman Daniel (born 1957) - has written and spoken publicly about his grandfather and his experiences as the grandchild of a president.<br /> * William Wallace Daniel (1959 - 2000) - who died in a New York City taxi cab collision<br /> * Harrison Gates Daniel (born 1963)<br /> * Thomas Washington Daniel (born 1966).<br /><br />She wrote several non-fiction and fiction books. Harry S. Truman (1972) was a critically acclaimed, full length biography of her father drawn from extensive resources at the Truman Library, published shortly before his death. Bess W. Truman (1986) was a detailed personal biography of her mother. She also wrote books on White House first ladies and pets, the history of the White House and its inhabitants, along with a critically successful series of fictional murder mysteries set in various locations in and around Washington, D.C. There have been claims these murder mysteries were ghost-written, perhaps by Donald Bain, but he denies this.[2][3] She continued to write and publish regularly into her eighties.<br /><br />In later life Mrs. Daniel resided in her Park Avenue home in Manhattan and served on the Board of Directors for the Harry S Truman Presidential Library and Museum along with the Board of Governors for the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute.<br /><br />Margaret Truman-Daniel died in Chicago at the age of 83 on January 29, 2008, following a brief illness during which she was on a respirator and living in an assisted care facility.[4] On February 23, following a private memorial service, her ashes and those of her husband E. Clifton Daniel were interred in her parents' burial plot at the Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri.<br /><br /><b>Series:</b><br />* <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/40428-capital-crimes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capital Crimes</a><br />",

In 1950, she was diagnosed with autism and her parents were told she should be institutionalized. She tells her story of \"groping her way from the far side of darkness\" in her book <i>Emergence: Labeled Autistic</i>, a book which stunned the world because, until its publication, most professionals and parents assumed that an autism diagnosis was virtually a death sentence to achievement or productivity in life.<br /><br />Even though she was considered \"weird\" in her young school years, she eventually found a mentor, who recognized her interests and abilities. Dr. Grandin later developed her talents into a successful career as a livestock-handling equipment designer, one of very few in the world. She has now designed the facilities in which half the cattle are handled in the United States, consulting for firms such as Burger King, McDonald's, Swift, and others.<br /><br />Dr. Grandin presently works as a Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University. She also speaks around the world on both autism and cattle handling.<br /><br />(Excerpted from Temple Grandin's Official Autism Website)",

        "biography": "Edith Newbold Jones was born into such wealth and privilege that her family inspired the phrase \"keeping up with the Joneses.\" The youngest of three children, Edith spent her early years touring Europe with her parents and, upon the family's return to the United States, enjoyed a privileged childhood in New York and Newport, Rhode Island. Edith's creativity and talent soon became obvious: By the age of eighteen she had written a novella, (as well as witty reviews of it) and published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly.<br /><br />After a failed engagement, Edith married a wealthy sportsman, Edward Wharton. Despite similar backgrounds and a shared taste for travel, the marriage was not a success. Many of Wharton's novels chronicle unhappy marriages, in which the demands of love and vocation often conflict with the expectations of society. Wharton's first major novel, <i>The House of Mirth,</i> published in 1905, enjoyed considerable literary success. <i>Ethan Frome</i> appeared six years later, solidifying Wharton's reputation as an important novelist. Often in the company of her close friend, Henry James, Wharton mingled with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and Jack London.<br /><br />In 1913 Edith divorced Edward. She lived mostly in France for the remainder of her life. When World War I broke out, she organized hostels for refugees, worked as a fund-raiser, and wrote for American publications from battlefield frontlines. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her courage and distinguished work.<br /><br /><i>The Age of Innocence,</i> a novel about New York in the 1870s, earned Wharton the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1921 -- the first time the award had been bestowed upon a woman. Wharton traveled throughout Europe to encourage young authors. She also continued to write, lying in her bed every morning, as she had always done, dropping each newly penned page on the floor to be collected and arranged when she was finished. Wharton suffered a stroke and died on August 11, 1937. She is buried in the American Cemetery in Versailles, France. <br /><i>- Barnesandnoble.com</i>",

In 1995, BBC Books published Angela\u2019s 30,000-word ending to Edith Wharton\u2019s last, unfinished novel, <i>The Buccaneers</i>, a story of love and marriage set among the British aristocracy and the American moneyed classes in late nineteenth-century England. <br /><br /><i>Speaking of Love</i> is Angela\u2019s first novel. It explores the relationship of a mother and daughter and what happens when they don't talk about the things that matter the most. It's about how parents fail their children and those same children abandon their parents because what matters most hasn\u2019t been said; about how lovers grow apart and how the mental disintegration that can follow a failure to communicate can prohibit communication altogether. But just before you decide it\u2019s too gloomy for words \u2026 it\u2019s also a novel about hope and the restoration of trust, a novel that shows how stories can help make sense of our complicated internal worlds, a novel about the healing power of stories and, most of all, about the healing power of speaking of love. <br /><br />It's been described as \u2018beautifully written\u2019 by Joanna Lumley, and \u2018suffused with a love of storytelling and a warmth that makes it a pleasure to read\u2019 by the <i>Daily Mail</i>. It's available in a Kindle edition, see here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00G4401G4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00G4401G4</a> for the uk or here, for the usa : <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4401G4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4401G4</a>. In print it's available second-hand (Beautful Books, its publisher, went out of business in 2011).<br /><br />Young's second novel, <i>The Dance of Love</i>, is historical fiction: a coming-of-age tale set in the same era as <i>Downton Abbey</i>. It spans two decades (1899-1919) of vast historical change and, through the joys and disappointments of its heroine, the beautiful, wealthy but independently-minded Natalie Edwardes, it reveals the many faces of love. It was published in 2014 by Buried River Press, a press that's now owned by Crowood Press. <br /><br />Young lives and writes in south-west London.

He drew the original maps for his father's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, which he signed C. J. R. T. The J. stands for John, a baptismal name that he does not ordinarily use.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a great deal of material connected to the Middle-earth mythos that was not published in his lifetime. Although he had originally intended to publish <i>The Silmarillion</i> along with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and parts of it were in a finished state, he died in 1973 with the project unfinished.<br /><br />After his father's death, Christopher Tolkien embarked on organizing the masses of his father's notes, some of them written on odd scraps of paper a half-century earlier. Much of the material was handwritten; frequently a fair draft was written over a half-erased first draft, and names of characters routinely changed between the beginning and end of the same draft. Deciphering this was an arduous task, and perhaps only someone with personal experience of J.R.R. Tolkien and the evolution of his stories could have made any sense of it. Christopher Tolkien has admitted to having to occasionally guess at what his father intended.",

His mother was the second wife of his father, Charlotte Martha was the daughter of Captain Alexander Burrowes Irwin.<br /><br />He was educated at Westminster School, King's College London, and Oxford University, where he was a contemporary of J.T. Delane, whose friend he had become at King's College. On leaving the university in 1840 he was appointed to a diplomatic post in Stockholm, Sweden. There he met Jakob Grimm, at whose recommendation he first became interested in Scandinavian literature and mythology.<br /><br />In 1842 he published the first result of his studies, an English translation of The Prose or Younger Edda. In the following year he translated Rask's Grammar of the Icelandic or Old-Norse Tongue, taken from the Swedish.<br /><br />Returning to England in 1845 he became assistant editor of The Times under Delane, whose sister he married; but he still continued his Scandinavian studies, publishing translations of various Norse stories. He also read for the Bar and was called in 1852.<br /><br />In 1853 he was appointed professor of English literature and modern history at King's College London and in 1859 he translated Popular Tales from the Norse (Norske Folkeeventyr) by Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen and J\u00f8rgen Moe, including in it an \"Introductory Essay on the Origin and Diffusion of Popular Tales.\"<br /><br />Perhaps his most well-known work, The Story of Burnt Njal, a translation of the Icelandic Njal's Saga that he had first attempted while in Stockholm, was issued in 1861. This was followed in 1861-1862 with a visit to Iceland, where he was hailed in Reykjav\u00edk as one of the saga lovers who had strengthened ties between the English and Norse. Subsequent to that visit, he published in 1866 his translation of Gisli the Outlaw from the Icelandic.<br /><br />Another well-known work is East O' the Sun and West O' the Moon, a collection of Norwegian fairy stories (including the tale of that name), charmingly translated from Norwegian Folktales by Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen and J\u00f8rgen Moe.<br /><br />In 1870 he was appointed a civil service commissioner and consequently resigned his post at The Times. In 1876 he was knighted in England, though he was already a Danish knight.<br /><br />Dasent retired from the public service in 1892 and died at Ascot on the 11th of June, 1896.<br /><br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

        "biography": "Jan Needle has written more than forty books, including novels for adults and children and literary criticism. He also writes plays for stage, TV and radio, including serials and series like Grange Hill, The Bill and Brookside. His first novel, Wild Wood, is a retelling of The Wind in the Willows with Toad, Rat, Mole and Co as the \u2018villains\u2019 - a sort of undeserving rural squirearchy \u2013 and the stoats and weasels as heroes. A new version was brought out recently by Golden Duck, with the original wonderful illustrations by the late Willie Rushton.<br /><br />Although he is currently working on a film of perhaps his most celebrated children\u2019s book, My Mate Shofiq, Jan has recently been concentrating on historical novels about his first and most enduring love, the sea, and a series of extremely gritty thrillers. His aim has always been to transcend standard genre writing, which has sometimes brought him disapproval. The \u2018hero\u2019 of his first naval fiction, A Fine Boy for Killing, is a borderline sadist, and life on the frigate Welfare undermines almost every heroic myth popularized by earlier writers. Loved or hated, his novels refuse to be ignored.<br /><br />His thrillers are also firmly in the \u2018noir\u2019 spectrum. The most recent is The Bonus Boys, which features a hard-as-nails investigator called Andrew Forbes and his Scottish lover Rosanna \u2018the Mouse\u2019 Nixon, who first appeared in Kicking Off, a chilling warning about the fissile state of Britain\u2019s crumbling prisons. More are in the pipeline, as are additions to a series of novellas about crime, the 18th century navy, and the secret world of spies and spying. Even the possibility that Napoleon escaped from his exile on St Helena is examined. Like many \u2018mere conspiracy theories\u2019 it uncovers some extraordinary possibilities.<br /><br />Jan also attempts, in conjunction with Walker Books, to widen the readership for certain classic novels. They include so far Moby Dick, Dracula, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and The Woman in White, all aimed at a young adult audience . In his spare time, he sails boats and plays a variety of musical instruments.<br />",

        "biography": "Ray Douglas Bradbury, American novelist, short story writer, essayist, playwright, screenwriter and poet, was born August 22, 1920 in Waukegan, Illinois. He graduated from a Los Angeles high school in 1938. Although his formal education ended there, he became a \"student of life,\" selling newspapers on L.A. street corners from 1938 to 1942, spending his nights in the public library and his days at the typewriter. He became a full-time writer in 1943, and contributed numerous short stories to periodicals before publishing a collection of them, <i>Dark Carnival,</i> in 1947. <br /><br />His reputation as a writer of courage and vision was established with the publication of <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> in 1950, which describes the first attempts of Earth people to conquer and colonize Mars, and the unintended consequences. Next came <i>The Illustrated Man</i> and then, in 1953, <i>Fahrenheit 451,</i> which many consider to be Bradbury's masterpiece, a scathing indictment of censorship set in a future world where the written word is forbidden. In an attempt to salvage their history and culture, a group of rebels memorize entire works of literature and philosophy as their books are burned by the totalitarian state. Other works include <i>The October Country, Dandelion Wine, A Medicine for Melancholy, Something Wicked This Way Comes, I Sing the Body Electric!, Quicker Than the Eye,</i> and <i>Driving Blind.</i> In all, Bradbury has published more than thirty books, close to 600 short stories, and numerous poems, essays, and plays. His short stories have appeared in more than 1,000 school curriculum \"recommended reading\" anthologies. <br /><br />Ray Bradbury's work has been included in four Best American Short Story collections. He has been awarded the O. Henry Memorial Award, the Benjamin Franklin Award, the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, the PEN Center USA West Lifetime Achievement Award, among others. In November 2000, the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters was conferred upon Mr. Bradbury at the 2000 National Book Awards Ceremony in New York City. <br /><br />Ray Bradbury has never confined his vision to the purely literary. He has been nominated for an Academy Award (for his animated film Icarus Montgolfier Wright), and has won an Emmy Award (for his teleplay of The Halloween Tree). He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's Ray Bradbury Theater. He was the creative consultant on the United States Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. In 1982 he created the interior metaphors for the Spaceship Earth display at Epcot Center, Disney World, and later contributed to the conception of the Orbitron space ride at Euro-Disney, France. <br /><br />Married since 1947, Mr. Bradbury and his wife Maggie lived in Los Angeles with their numerous cats. Together, they raised four daughters and had eight grandchildren. Sadly, Maggie passed away in November of 2003. <br /><br />On the occasion of his 80th birthday in August 2000, Bradbury said, \"The great fun in my life has been getting up every morning and rushing to the typewriter because some new idea has hit me. The feeling I have every day is very much the same as it was when I was twelve. In any event, here I am, eighty years old, feeling no different, full of a great sense of joy, and glad for the long life that has been allowed me. I have good plans for the next ten or twenty years, and I hope you'll come along.\"",

        "biography": "Martini's first career was in journalism. He worked as a newspaper reporter for the Los Angeles Daily Journal, the largest legal newspaper in the country covering the state, the local courts and the civic center beat. In 1970 he became the newspaper\u2019s first correspondent at the State Capitol in Sacramento and later its bureau chief. There he specialized in legal and political coverage. During this period he attended night law school and in 1974 took his law degree from the University of the Pacific\u2019s McGeorge School of Law. He was admitted to the Bar in January 1975.<br /><br />Martini has practiced law both privately as well as for public agencies appearing in state and federal courts. During his law career, in addition to other activities, he worked as a legislative representative for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the State Bar of California, and served as special counsel to the California Victims of Violent Crimes Program. He has worked as an administrative hearing officer, a supervising hearing officer, an administrative law judge, and for a time served as Deputy Director of the State Office of Administrative Hearings. He is currently inactive with the State Bar of California, choosing writing instead as a full-time occupation.<br /><br />In the mid-1980s Martini began his fiction-writing career. His first attempt at a novel, The Simeon Chamber, was represented by an agent and sold to the New York publisher D.I. Fine within two weeks of its submission. It was published in 1987. Compelling Evidence, his second novel, introduced his series character, attorney Paul Madriani, and was published by G.P. Putnam &amp; Sons. A national bestseller, the novel earned Martini a critical and popular following. It was followed quickly by New York Times bestsellers Prime Witness, Undue Influence, The Judge, and The Attorney, each featuring the series character Madriani and his contrarian and irrepressible law partner, Harry Hinds.<br /><br />The List, published in 1997, a novel and thriller about the commercial book publishing industry, was the first Martini novel to depart from the series characters since the author reached the best sellers list. Critical Mass, his next novel published in 1998, continued the departure from the courtroom as well as the Madriani series, though it involved a lawyer protagonist and was well within the legal-thriller genre. Critical Mass addressed issues of terrorism and the threat from weapons of mass destruction two years before the events of 9/11. It was a topic to which Martini would return in later years.<br /><br />Other novels by Martini include: The Jury, The Arraignment, Double Tap, Shadow of Power, Guardian of Lies, The Rule of Nine, and Trader of Secrets.<br /><br />To date, two network mini-series have been produced and broadcast based on Martini\u2019s works, Undue Influence by CBS, and The Judge on NBC.",

His first novel, a humorous fantasy entitled <i>The Carpet People</i>, appeared in 1971 from the publisher Colin Smythe. <br /><br />Terry worked for many years as a journalist and press officer, writing in his spare time and publishing a number of novels, including his first Discworld novel, <i>The Color of Magic</i>, in 1983.

He is noted for his novels <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> (1885), called \"the Great American Novel\", and <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> (1876).<br /><br />Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which would later provide the setting for <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. He apprenticed with a printer. He also worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to his older brother Orion's newspaper. After toiling as a printer in various cities, he became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, before heading west to join Orion. He was a failure at gold mining, so he next turned to journalism. While a reporter, he wrote a humorous story, \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" which proved to be very popular and brought him nationwide attention. His travelogues were also well-received. Twain had found his calling.<br /><br />He achieved great success as a writer and public speaker. His wit and satire earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.<br /><br />However, he lacked financial acumen. Though he made a great deal of money from his writings and lectures, he squandered it on various ventures, in particular the Paige Compositor, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. With the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers, however, he eventually overcame his financial troubles. Twain worked hard to ensure that all of his creditors were paid in full, even though his bankruptcy had relieved him of the legal responsibility.<br /><br />Born during a visit by Halley's Comet, he died on its return. He was lauded as the \"greatest American humorist of his age\", and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3535.William_Faulkner\" title=\"William Faulkner\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Faulkner</a> called Twain \"the father of American literature\".<br /><br /><i>Excerpted from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</i><br /><br />AKA:<br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14956076.___________\" title=\"\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03af\u03bd</a> (Greek)",

The first edition of her best known book Work Your Way Around the World was researched in 1982 mainly by listening attentively to the stories of travelers met abroad and by interviewing people summoned to the Nag\u2019s Head (the pub behind her publisher\u2019s office in Oxford). At that time she had plenty of personal experience of working abroad since she had left her native Canada after doing a degree in English at the University of Toronto to study at Oxford and then decided to stay on working in England.<br /><br />In the early 1980s so few guidebooks about funding yourself on the road were available that travelers were grateful for any scrap of information and encouragement. The world of travel has changed dramatically since then. Working abroad has become such a mainstream idea that it has given rise to scores of web sites; student travel agencies have specialist working abroad departments and a huge infrastructure has developed for those who want to combine work and travel. Work Your Way has grown up with the travel industry and now takes account of all the shortcuts to fixing up work abroad that now exist. Personally updated every other year since its beginnings, it is now an acknowledged classic in the field. Other titles which Susan has written and regularly updates include Teaching English Abroad which gives a comprehensive account of that booming business, Taking a Gap Year, The Au Pair &amp; Nanny's Guide to Working Abroad, and Gap Years for Grown Ups. She has also been a contributing editor to Transitions Abroad since the early days of its publication and contributes occasional articles to the travel pages of The Independent, a British daily newspaper. Her consistent aim has been to make her writing as concrete and up-to-the-minute as possible, to cut out vague generalities and meaningless waffle.<br /><br />Susan has traveled relentlessly both for work and pleasure, and has spent substantial periods of time on her own in the Indian Subcontinent and the Antipodes including Papua New Guinea. She also travels widely with her family including her partner, who is the Oxford Professor of Latin and is therefore interested in travel to ancient sites around the Mediterranean. Now based in Cambridge, she is hoping that her twin sons who have hit adolescence will have imbibed a love of travel since she is all the more convinced that a spell of independent travel in wild and woolly places is a good and necessary thing.",

We must, however, handle these with some caution, since some of the poems (\"Idylls\") commonly attributed to him have little claim to authenticity. It is clear that at a very early date two collections were made, one of which included a number of doubtful poems and formed a corpus of bucolic poetry, while the other was confined to those works which were considered to be by Theocritus himself. He was probably from Sicily, as he refers to Polyphemus, the cyclops in the Odyssey, as his 'countryman.' He also probably lived in Alexandria for a while, where he wrote about everyday life, notably Pharmkeutra. It is also speculated that Theocritus was born in Syracuse, lived on the island, Kos, and lived in Egypt during the time of Ptolemy II.<br /><br />",

The other poem attributed to Hesiod or his school which has come down in great part to modern times is <i>The Theogony</i>, a work of grander scope, inspired alike by older traditions and abundant local associations. It is an attempt to work into system, as none had essayed to do before, the floating legends of the gods and goddesses and their offspring.<br /><br /><i>Source: NNDB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nndb.com/people/837/000087576/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nndb.com/people/837/000087...</a> </i>",

        "biography": "In 1866, (Herbert George) H. G. Wells was born to a working class family in Kent, England. Young Wells received a spotty education, interrupted by several illnesses and family difficulties, and became a draper's apprentice as a teenager. The headmaster of Midhurst Grammar School, where he had spent a year, arranged for him to return as an \"usher,\" or student teacher. Wells earned a government scholarship in 1884, to study biology under <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17171.Thomas_Henry_Huxley\" title=\"Thomas Henry Huxley\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> at the Normal School of Science. Wells earned his bachelor of science and doctor of science degrees at the University of London. After marrying his cousin, Isabel, Wells began to supplement his teaching salary with short stories and freelance articles, then books, including The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898).<br /><br />Wells created a mild scandal when he divorced his cousin to marry one of his best students, Amy Catherine Robbins. Although his second marriage was lasting and produced two sons, Wells was an unabashed advocate of free (as opposed to \"indiscriminate\") love. He continued to openly have extra-marital liaisons, most famously with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/264856.Margaret_Sanger\" title=\"Margaret Sanger\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margaret Sanger</a>, and a ten-year relationship with the author <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8111.Rebecca_West\" title=\"Rebecca West\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rebecca West</a>, who had one of his two out-of-wedlock children. A one-time member of the Fabian Society, Wells sought active change. His 100 books included many novels, as well as nonfiction, such as A Modern Utopia (1905), The Outline of History (1920), A Short History of the World (1922), The Shape of Things to Come (1933), and The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1932). One of his booklets was Crux Ansata, An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church. Although Wells toyed briefly with the idea of a \"divine will\" in his book, God the Invisible King (1917), it was a temporary aberration. Wells used his international fame to promote his favorite causes, including the prevention of war, and was received by government officials around the world. He is best-remembered as an early writer of science fiction and futurism.<br /><br />He was also an outspoken socialist. Wells and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/696805.Jules_Verne\" title=\"Jules Verne\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jules Verne</a> are each sometimes referred to as \"The Fathers of Science Fiction\".

She lived in Portland, Oregon.<br /><br />She was known for her treatment of gender (The Left Hand of Darkness, The Matter of Seggri), political systems (The Telling, The Dispossessed) and difference/otherness in any other form. Her interest in non-Western philosophies was reflected in works such as 'Solitude' and 'The Telling' but even more interesting are her imagined societies, often mixing traits extracted from her profound knowledge of anthropology acquired from growing up with her father, the famous anthropologist, Alfred Kroeber. The Hainish Cycle reflects the anthropologist's experience of immersing themselves in new strange cultures since most of their main characters and narrators (Le Guin favoured the first person narration) are envoys from a humanitarian organization, the Ekumen, sent to investigate or ally themselves with the people of a different world and learn their ways.",

He is regarded as one of the greatest British poets and remains widely read and influential, both in the English-speaking world and beyond.<br /><br />Byron's notabilty rests not only on his writings but also on his life, which featured upper-class living, numerous love affairs, debts, and separation. He was notably described by Lady Caroline Lamb as \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\". Byron served as a regional leader of Italy's revolutionary organization, the Carbonari, in its struggle against Austria. He later travelled to fight against the Ottoman Empire in the Greek War of Independence, for which Greeks revere him as a national hero. He died from a fever contracted while in Messolonghi in Greece.",

        "biography": "Orhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul in 1952 and grew up in a large family similar to those which he describes in his novels Cevdet Bey and His Sons and The Black Book, in the wealthy westernised district of Nisantasi. As he writes in his autobiographical book Istanbul, from his childhood until the age of 22 he devoted himself largely to painting and dreamed of becoming an artist. After graduating from the secular American Robert College in Istanbul, he studied architecture at Istanbul Technical University for three years, but abandoned the course when he gave up his ambition to become an architect and artist. He went on to graduate in journalism from Istanbul University, but never worked as a journalist. At the age of 23 Pamuk decided to become a novelist, and giving up everything else retreated into his flat and began to write.<br /><br />His first novel <i>Cevdet Bey and His Sons</i> was published seven years later in 1982. The novel is the story of three generations of a wealthy Istanbul family living in Nisantasi, Pamuk's own home district. The novel was awarded both the Orhan Kemal and Milliyet literary prizes. The following year Pamuk published his novel <i>The Silent House</i>, which in French translation won the 1991 Prix de la d\u00e9couverte europ\u00e9ene. <i>The White Castle</i> (1985) about the frictions and friendship between a Venetian slave and an Ottoman scholar was published in English and many other languages from 1990 onwards, bringing Pamuk his first international fame. The same year Pamuk went to America, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York from 1985 to 1988. It was there that he wrote most of his novel <i>The Black Book</i>, in which the streets, past, chemistry and texture of Istanbul are described through the story of a lawyer seeking his missing wife. This novel was published in Turkey in 1990, and the French translation won the Prix France Culture. <i>The Black Book</i> enlarged Pamuk's fame both in Turkey and internationally as an author at once popular and experimental, and able to write about past and present with the same intensity. In 1991 Pamuk's daughter R\u00fcya was born. That year saw the production of a film Hidden Face, whose script by Pamuk was based on a one-page story in <i>The Black Book</i>.<br /><br />His novel <i>The New Life</i>, about young university students influenced by a mysterious book, was published in Turkey in 1994 and became one of the most widely read books in Turkish literature. <i>My Name Is Red</i>, about Ottoman and Persian artists and their ways of seeing and portraying the non-western world, told through a love story and family story, was published in 1998. This novel won the French Prix du meilleur livre \u00e9tranger, the Italian Grinzane Cavour (2002) and the International IMPAC Dublin literary award (2003). From the mid-1990s Pamuk took a critical stance towards the Turkish state in articles about human rights and freedom of thought, although he took little interest in politics. <i>Snow</i>, which he describes as \u201cmy first and last political novel\u201d was published in 2002. In this book set in the small city of Kars in northeastern Turkey he experimented with a new type of \u201cpolitical novel\u201d, telling the story of violence and tension between political Islamists, soldiers, secularists, and Kurdish and Turkish nationalists. <i>Snow</i> was selected as one of the best 100 books of 2004 by The New York Times. In 1999 a selection of his articles on literature and culture written for newspapers and magazines in Turkey and abroad, together with a selection of writings from his private notebooks, was published under the title <i>Other Colours</i>. Pamuk's most recent book, Istanbul, is a poetical work that is hard to classify, combining the author's early memoirs up to the age of 22, and an essay about the city of Istanbul, illustrated with photographs from his own album, and pictures by western painters and Turkish photographers.",

        "biography": "I was born on June 1, 1941. My first home was an apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side, a neighborhood that overlooked the George Washington Bridge. Soon after kindergarten, my family moved to Scarsdale, which seemed to be \u201cin the country.\u201d In high school, I broke my ankle when I went out for the lacrosse team, so I wrote a sports column for the school newspaper. I don't think I showed any particular talent for writing then.<br /><br />I went to St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. I actually learned to read Greek (I didn't understand it, though). I transferred from St. John's to New York University, so I could study political science and economics. I graduated with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. My first job was a market researcher for a beer company in New Jersey. Over the next five years, I switched jobs several times: advertising copywriter, advertising account executive, and marketing manager at a candy company.<br /><br />I married Vicki and we had a baby, Douglas. I wanted him to have a home surrounded by grass and trees and ball fields, so I accepted a job in Minnesota, and Doug got a baby sister, Dana. What rescued me from poverty was that my wife and some other mothers wrote a cookbook. We published it ourselves, and it was a huge hit. That's how I figured out that I wanted to be a publisher when I grew up. We built Meadowbrook Press, and I became an author of baby name books and humor books for adults.<br /><br />Ten years ago, I wanted to put together a children's book of all the poems they loved best. To find these poems, I tested poems in elementary schools. As I was testing poems on children, I decided to write a few to see what the response would be. At first it wasn't that good, but as my writing improved, I added my poems to new books. To get them just right, I'd rewrite them over and over. I've now edited six poetry anthologies and filled three books with my own poems. Because I spent a lot of time reading and testing poems in classrooms, schools started inviting me to perform. I've now performed at hundreds of schools. My goal to put on the most entertaining, most educational, and most motivating assembly a school has ever had. My web site, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gigglepoetry.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gigglepoetry.com</a>, helps kids discover the fun of reading and writing poetry.<br /><br />Language arts are a very important part of what you learn in school. You can read great books that take you to far-away lands. You can write your own stories and make yourself the hero of exciting adventures. Even if it seems hard sometimes, don't give up. Keep practicing your reading and writing skills, and soon it will become easier. There are so many wonderful worlds to explore in books and poetry. Get your very own passport by learning to read and write the very best that you can.<br /><br />",

        "biography": "Anthony David Bernard Sylvester CBE, (21 September 1924; London \u2013 19 June 2001; London) was a British art critic and curator. During a long career David Sylvester was influential in promoting modern art in Britain, in particular the work of Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon.<br /><br />Born into a well connected north-London Jewish family, Sylvester had trouble as a student at University College School and was thrown out of the family home. He wrote for the paper Tribune and went to Paris in 1947 where he met Alberto Giacometti one of the strongest influences on him. Though writing for a range of publications as a critic including The Observer and New Statesman the main thrust of his writing that direct response to the artwork was most important remained constant. Sylvester is credited with coining the term kitchen sink originally to describe a strand of post-war British painting typified by John Bratby. Sylvester used the phrase negatively but it was widely applied to other art forms including literature and theatre. During the 1950s Sylvester worked with Henry Moore, Freud and Bacon but also supported Richard Hamilton and the other 'Young Turks' of British pop art. This led him to become a prominent media figure in the 1960s. During the 1960s and 70s Sylvester occupied a number of roles at the Arts Council of Great Britain serving on advisory panels and on the main panel. In 1969 he curated a Renoir exhibition at the Hayward Gallery for which he was assisted by a young Nicholas Serota.",

An alleged descendant of Sun Tzu, Sun Bin was tutored in military strategy by the hermit Guiguzi. He was accused of treason while serving in the Wei state and was sentenced to face-tattooing (criminal branding) and had his kneecaps removed, permanently crippling him. Sun escaped from Wei later and rose to prominence in the Qi state, by serving as a military strategist and commander. He led Qi to victory against the Wei state at the Battle of Guiling and Battle of Maling. Sun authored the military treatise Sun Bin's Art of War, which was rediscovered in a 1972 archaeological excavation after being lost for almost 2000 years.",

Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet \"Prince of the Humanists\", and has been called \"the crowning glory of the Christian humanists\". Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament, which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13259270.On_Free_Will\" title=\"On Free Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">On Free Will</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/449017.The_Praise_of_Folly\" title=\"The Praise of Folly\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Praise of Folly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com:443/search/search?q=Handbook of a Christian Knight\" title=\"Handbook of a Christian Knight\">Handbook of a Christian Knight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com:443/search/search?q=On Civility in Children\" title=\"On Civility in Children\">On Civility in Children</a>, Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style, Julius Exclusus,</i> and many other works.<br /><br />Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation, but while he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, he kept his distance from Luther and Melanchthon and continued to recognise the authority of the pope, emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, rejecting Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church all his life, remaining committed to reforming the Church and its clerics' abuses from within. He also held to the Catholic doctrine of free will, which some Reformers rejected in favor of the doctrine of predestination. His middle road approach disappointed and even angered scholars in both camps.<br /><br />Erasmus died suddenly in Basel in 1536 while preparing to return to Brabant, and was buried in the Basel Minster, the former cathedral of the city. A bronze statue of him was erected in his city of birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.",

        "biography": "Martin Luther was a German monk, theologian, university professor and church reformer whose ideas inspired the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization.<br /><br />Luther's theology challenged the authority of the papacy by holding that the Bible is the only infallible source of religious authority and that all baptized Christians under Jesus are a spiritual priesthood. According to Luther, salvation was a free gift of God, received only by true repentance and faith in Jesus as the Messiah, a faith given by God and unmediated by the church.<br /><br />Luther's confrontation with Charles V at the Diet of Worms over freedom of conscience in 1521 and his refusal to submit to the authority of the Emperor resulted in his being declared an outlaw of the state as he had been excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. Because of the perceived unity of the medieval Church with the secular rulers of western Europe, the widespread acceptance of Luther's doctrines and popular vindication of his thinking on individual liberties were both phenomenal and unprecedented.<br /><br />His translation of the Bible into the vernacular, making it more accessible to ordinary people, had a tremendous political impact on the church and on German culture. It furthered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the translation of the English <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867456.King_James_Bible\" title=\"King James Bible\" rel=\"nofollow\">King James Bible</a>. His hymns inspired the development of congregational singing within Christianity. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.<br /><br />Much scholarly debate has concentrated on Luther's writings about the Jews. His statements that Jews' homes should be destroyed, their synagogues burned, money confiscated and liberty curtailed were revived and used in propaganda by the Nazis in 1933\u201345. As a result of this and his revolutionary theological views, his legacy remains controversial.<br />",

        "biography": "Harper Lee, known as Nelle, was born in the Alabama town of Monroeville, the youngest of four children of Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch Lee. Her father, a former newspaper editor and proprietor, was a lawyer who served on the state legislature from 1926 to 1938. As a child, Lee was a tomboy and a precocious reader, and enjoyed the friendship of her schoolmate and neighbor, the young Truman Capote.<br /><br />After graduating from high school in Monroeville, Lee enrolled at the all-female Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944-45), and then pursued a law degree at the University of Alabama (1945-50), pledging the Chi Omega sorority. While there, she wrote for several student publications and spent a year as editor of the campus humor magazine, \"Ramma-Jamma\". Though she did not complete the law degree, she studied for a summer in Oxford, England, before moving to New York in 1950, where she worked as a reservation clerk with Eastern Air Lines and BOAC.<br /><br />Lee continued as a reservation clerk until the late 50s, when she devoted herself to writing. She lived a frugal life, traveling between her cold-water-only apartment in New York to her family home in Alabama to care for her father.<br /><br />Having written several long stories, Harper Lee located an agent in November 1956. The following month at the East 50th townhouse of her friends Michael Brown and Joy Williams Brown, she received a gift of a year's wages with a note: \"You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.\" <br /><br />Within a year, she had a first draft. Working with J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. editor Tay Hohoff, she completed <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> in the summer of 1959. Published July 11, 1960, the novel was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It remains a bestseller with more than 30 million copies in print. In 1999, it was voted \"Best Novel of the Century\" in a poll by the Library Journal.",

        "biography": "David Harold Chilton (1951\u20131997) was a Reformed pastor, Christian Reconstructionist, speaker, and author of several books on economics, eschatology and Christian Worldview from Placerville, California. He contributed three books on eschatology: Paradise Restored (1985), The Days of Vengeance (1987), and The Great Tribulation (1987).<br /><br />His book Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider (1981) was a response to Ronald J. Sider's best-selling book, Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger: A Biblical Study (1977), which promoted various programs of wealth redistribution by the government. Chilton argued that the Bible either does not authorize such programs or explicitly teaches against them.<br /><br />His book Power in the Blood: A Christian Response to AIDS (1987) was primarily dealing with the Church's relationship with the world.<br /><br />David Chilton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1951. At the age of one, he moved with his Christian missionary parents to the Philippines. At the age of 8, the family returned to the United States where his father became a pastor in Southern California. Growing up in California in the 1970s youth movement and hippie culture, he experienced a conversion to Christianity while listening to a missionary speak at his father's church. He began reading the Bible and teaching Bible studies. The young Chilton consequently became deeply involved in the nascent Jesus People movement, and started a singing group with his sister Jayn and some friends called The Children of Light. He frequently spoke, performed music, and taught Bible studies at Christian coffeehouses in Los Angeles, California region. He was ordained in the Jesus People Movement by Pat Boone.<br /><br />Chilton came to prominence as a writer for the Chalcedon Report edited by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/53534.R_J__Rushdoony\" title=\"R.J. Rushdoony\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Rushdoony</a> after a Christian friend recommended one of Rushdoony's books. At the same time, Chilton discovered the writings of the Puritans, and was exposed for the first time to Reformed theology as a result of reading these books, and to the doctrines of predestination, election, and perseverance of the saints. After meeting Rushdoony, Chilton was asked to write a monthly column for Chalcedon Report while alternating speaking for Dr. Rushdoony at his church in Hollywood (which was affiliated with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) while pastoring a church in Anaheim, California. At this time Chilton was also influenced by fellow Christian Reconstructionists <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/265621.Greg_Bahnsen\" title=\"Greg Bahnsen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greg Bahnsen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/278395.James_B__Jordan\" title=\"James B. Jordan\" rel=\"nofollow\">James B. Jordan</a>. He married his wife, Darlene, and had 3 children, Nathan, Jacob, and Abigail.<br />In 1981, after several years of pastoring in Anaheim, Chilton wrote his first book, Productive Christians in an Age of Guilt-Manipulators: A Biblical Response to Ronald J. Sider over the course of a month with a pencil and paper at a coffeehouse. Not long after the completion of the book, he moved to Placerville, CA to pastor a church for a year, during which he wrote a newsletter for Christian teachers and homeschoolers called The Biblical Educator. Chilton also used his influence to help launch World Magazine with Joel Belz and wrote a monthly column for the publication for years, which was very popular.<br /><br />Although Chilton loved the people of Placerville and did not want to leave, he accepted a job offer from prominent Reconstructionist (and Rushdoony son-in-law) <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/167726.Gary_North\" title=\"Gary North\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gary North</a> as a research assistant at The Institute for Christian Economics in Tyler, Texas. It was during his three year stay in Texas that North commissioned Chilton to write his two books for North's imprint Dominion Press: Paradise Restored and Days of Vengeance.<br /><br />In 1986 Chilton accepted an offer to return to Placerville to pastor the church there. He continued to work in pastoral ministry, speak at conferences, write a weekly column for The Sacramento Union newspaper, was counsel for The Fieldstead Co. at an economic conference in Switzerland and wro",

The reasons were simple. Don was the first known to have reversed CHF by cutting salt out of his life completely. No salt in anything. He has crafted five no salt, low sodium cookbooks. It was his effort at avoiding a heart transplant and proving that salt did indeed have something to do with promoting heart disease, Meniere's Syndrome, stomach cancer, Nephrotic Syndrome and other ailments including hypertension. Through is effort he as helped saved thousands of lives as well as helping hundreds to avoid a heart transplant. In Living Well Without Salt, Don walks the reader through the steps he took to regain his heart and to live on with a normal life. Now with 200 recipes and chock full of foods you can eat, his book has become a best seller among those who need to lower the sodium in their diets.<br /><br />Source: <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/dongazz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smashwords biography</a>.",

Parasites and Your Health. In Your Body Knows Best, Dr. Ann Louise was the first to discuss the blood type/weight theory and proclaim that one diet may not be right for every body - an idea that is only now becoming mainstream. She was the first to offer natural remedies for menopausal symptoms in Super Nutrition for Menopause (now in print as Hot Times) and is widely credited as the first to popularize the term \u201cperimenopause\u201d in her New York Times bestseller, Before The Change.<br /><br />Dr. Ann Louise forged new ways of thinking about obesity early on in her career. She was the first to proclaim that obesity was caused by the lack of dietary fats and the wrong kind of carbohydrates in her book Beyond Pritikin, published in 1988. In Beyond Pritikin, she predicted that the fat-free, carb-rich diet was creating weight gain, sugar cravings, fatigue and diabetes.<br /><br />Today, she continues to dedicate herself to carving out new landmarks in holistic health and healing based on science and ancient healing arts. Through her many books, website, and blog (Dr. Ann Louise\u2019s Edge on Health), Dr. Ann Louise offers a \u201cvirtual\u201d health support system for men and women that provides educational and self-health assessment services to empower people everywhere to achieve total health.

        "biography": "Hannah Arendt (1906\u20131975) was one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century. Born into a German-Jewish family, she was forced to leave Germany in 1933 and lived in Paris for the next eight years, working for a number of Jewish refugee organisations. In 1941 she immigrated to the United States and soon became part of a lively intellectual circle in New York. She held a number of academic positions at various American universities until her death in 1975. She is best known for two works that had a major impact both within and outside the academic community. The first, <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, published in 1951, was a study of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes that generated a wide-ranging debate on the nature and historical antecedents of the totalitarian phenomenon. The second, <i>The Human Condition</i>, published in 1958, was an original philosophical study that investigated the fundamental categories of the vita activa (labor, work, action). In addition to these two important works, Arendt published a number of influential essays on topics such as the nature of revolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age. At the time of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes of her last major philosophical work, <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, which examined the three fundamental faculties of the vita contemplativa (thinking, willing, judging).",

He was at times associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory and was also greatly inspired by the Marxism of Bertolt Brecht and Jewish mysticism as presented by Gershom Scholem.<br /><br />As a sociological and cultural critic, Benjamin combined ideas drawn from historical materialism, German idealism, and Jewish mysticism in a body of work which was a novel contribution to western philosophy, Marxism, and aesthetic theory. As a literary scholar, he translated the Tableaux Parisiens edition of Baudelaire's <i>Les Fleurs du mal</i> as well as Proust's <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>. His work is widely cited in academic and literary studies, in particular his essays <i>The Task of the Translator</i> and <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>. Influenced by Bachofen, Benjamin gave the name \"auratic perception\" to the aesthetic faculty through which civilization would recover a lost appreciation of myth.",

He was responsible for systematizing the order's doctrines and recording the biographies of its founder, Sidi Abu-l-Hassan ash-Shadhili, and his successor, Sidi Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi. Ibn 'Ata Allah was the author of the first systematic treatise on dhikr, titled The Key to Salvation: A Sufi Manual of Invocation (Miftah al-Falah) and his compilation of aphorisms (hikam) helped to make the group very popular. Commentaries on the hikam have been made by some of the most famous of the Shadhili order such as Ibn Abbad al-Rundi, Sheikh Ahmed Zarruq founder of the Zarruqiyya Sufi order and Ahmad ibn Ajiba. The wide circulation of his written works led to the spread of the Shadhili order in North Africa, where the order's founder had been rejected in earlier attempts. The Wafai Sufi order was also derived from his works. He died in 1309 while in Cairo.",

        "biography": "He was born Abraham Stoker in 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent \u2013 then as now called \"The Crescent\" \u2013 in Fairview, a coastal suburb of Dublin, Ireland. His parents were Abraham Stoker and the feminist Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornely. Stoker was the third of seven children. Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Clontarf Church of Ireland parish and attended the parish church (St. John the Baptist located on Seafield Road West) with their children, who were both baptised there.<br /><br />Stoker was an invalid until he started school at the age of seven \u2014 when he made a complete and astounding recovery. Of this time, Stoker wrote, \"I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.\"<br /><br />After his recovery, he became a normal young man, even excelling as an athlete (he was named University Athlete) at Trinity College, Dublin (1864 \u2013 70), from which he graduated with honours in mathematics. He was auditor of the College Historical Society and president of the University Philosophical Society, where his first paper was on \"Sensationalism in Fiction and Society\".<br /><br />In 1876, while employed as a civil servant in Dublin, Stoker wrote a non-fiction book (The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland, published 1879) and theatre reviews for The Dublin Mail, a newspaper partly owned by fellow horror writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu. His interest in theatre led to a lifelong friendship with the English actor Henry Irving. He also wrote stories, and in 1872 \"The Crystal Cup\" was published by the London Society, followed by \"The Chain of Destiny\" in four parts in The Shamrock.<br /><br />In 1878 Stoker married Florence Balcombe, a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was Oscar Wilde. The couple moved to London, where Stoker became business manager (at first as acting-manager) of Irving's Lyceum Theatre, a post he held for 27 years. The collaboration with Irving was very important for Stoker and through him he became involved in London's high society, where he met, among other notables, James McNeil Whistler, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the course of Irving's tours, Stoker got the chance to travel around the world.<br /><br />The Stokers had one son, Irving Noel, who was born on December 31, 1879.<br /><br />Bram Stoker died in 1912, and was cremated and his ashes placed in a display urn at Golders Green Crematorium. After Irving Noel Stoker's death in 1961, his ashes were added to that urn. The original plan had been to keep his parents' ashes together, but after Florence Stoker's death her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest.<br />See also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker</a>",

        "biography": "Dr. Ernest Becker was a cultural anthropologist and interdisciplinary scientific thinker and writer.<br /><br />Becker was born in Springfield, Massachusetts to Jewish immigrant parents. After completing military service, in which he served in the infantry and helped to liberate a Nazi concentration camp, he attended Syracuse University in New York. Upon graduation he joined the US Embassy in Paris as an administrative officer. In his early 30s, he returned to Syracuse University to pursue graduate studies in cultural anthropology. He completed his Ph.D. in 1960. The first of his nine books, Zen, A Rational Critique (1961) was based on his doctoral dissertation. After Syracuse, he became a professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC (Canada).<br /><br />Becker came to the recognition that psychological inquiry inevitably comes to a dead end beyond which belief systems must be invoked to satisfy the human psyche. The reach of such a perspective consequently encompasses science and religion, even to what Sam Keen suggests is Becker's greatest achievement, the creation of the \"science of evil.\" In formulating his theories Becker drew on the work of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Norman O. Brown, Erich Fromm, and especially Otto Rank. Becker came to believe that a person's character is essentially formed around the process of denying his own mortality, that this denial is necessary for the person to function in the world, and that this character-armor prevents genuine self-knowledge. Much of the evil in the world, he believed, was a consequence of this need to deny death.<br /><br />Because of his breadth of vision and avoidance of social science specialization, Becker was an academic outcast in the last decade of his life. It was only with the award of the Pulitzer Prize in 1974 for his 1973 book, The Denial of Death (two months after his own death from cancer at the age of 49) that he gained wider recognition. Escape From Evil (1975) was intended as a significant extension of the line of reasoning begun in Denial of Death, developing the social and cultural implications of the concepts explored in the earlier book. Although the manuscript's second half was left unfinished at the time of his death, it was completed from what manuscript existed as well as from notes on the unfinished chapter.<br /><br />The Ernest Becker Foundation is devoted to multidisciplinary inquiries into human behavior, with a particular focus on contributing to the reduction of violence in human society, using Becker's basic ideas to support research and application at the interfaces of science, the humanities, social action and religion.<br /><br />Some of the above information is from the EBF website and used by permission.<br /><br />Becker also wrote The Birth and Death of Meaning which gets its title from the concept of man moving away from the simple minded ape into a world of symbols and illusions, and then deconstructing those illusions through his own evolving intellect.<br /><br />Flight From Death (2006) is a documentary film directed by Patrick Shen, based on Becker's work, and partially funded by the Ernest Becker Foundation.<br />",

Since then, his production has increased considerably, including a variety of genres, from novel to social essay, or poetry. One of the most common themes that appears on his books is the dialectics established between modernity and memory and loss, <br /><br />Another of his most remarkable works has been the trilogy titled <b>Into Their Labours</b>, that includes the books <b>Pig Earth</b> (1979), <b>Once In Europa</b> (1983) <b>Lilac And Flag</b> (1990). With those books, Berger makes a meditation about the way of the peasant, that changes one poverty for another in the city. This theme is also observed in his novel <b>King</b>, but there he focuses more in the rural diaspora and the bitter side of the urban way of life.",

        "biography": "Helen Levitt (August 31, 1913 \u2013 March 29, 2009) was an American photographer. She was particularly noted for \"street photography\" around New York City, and has been called \"the most celebrated and least known photographer of her time.\"<br /><br />Levitt grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY. She dropped out of high school and went to work for a commercial photographer. There, she taught herself photography. While teaching art classes to children in 1937, Levitt became intrigued with the transitory chalk drawings that were part of the New York children's street culture of the time. She purchased a Leica camera and began to photograph these works, as well as the children who made them. The resulting photographs were ultimately published in 1987 as <i>In The Street: chalk drawings and messages, New York City 1938\u20131948</i>.<br /><br />She associated with Walker Evans in 1938-39. She enjoyed early success. In July 1939, the new photography section of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City included Levitt's work in its inaugural exhibition. In 1943, Nancy Newhall curated her first solo exhibition \"Helen Levitt: Photographs of Children\" there. Her next major shows were in the 1960s; Amanda Hopkinson suggests that this second wave of recognition was related to the feminist rediscovery of women's creative achievements.<br /><br />In the late 1940s, Levitt made two documentary films with Janice Loeb and James Agee: <i>In the Street</i> (1948) and <i>The Quiet One</i> (1948). Levitt, along with Loeb and Sidney Meyers, received an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay of <i>The Quiet One</i>. Levitt was active in film making for nearly 25 years; her final film credit is as an editor for John Cohen's documentary <i>The End of an Old Song</i> (1972). Levitt's other film credits include the cinematography on <i>The Savage Eye</i> (1960), which was produced by Ben Maddow, Meyers, and Joseph Strick, and also as an assistant director for Strick and Maddow's film version of Genet's play <i>The Balcony</i> (1963). In her biographical essay, Maria Hambourg writes that Levitt \"has all but disinherited this part of her work.\"<br /><br />In 1959 and 1960, Levitt received two Guggenheim Foundation grants to take color photographs on the streets of New York, and she returned to still photography. In 1965 she published her first major collection, <i>A Way of Seeing</i>. Much of her work in color from the 1960s was stolen in a 1970 burglary of her East 13th Street apartment. The remaining photos, and others taken in the following years, can be seen in the 2005 book <i>Slide Show: The Color Photographs of Helen Levitt</i>. In 1976, she was a Photography Fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts.<br /><br />She lived in New York City and remained active as a photographer for nearly 70 years.<br /><br />(from Wikipedia)",

        "biography": "An American author, journalist, poet, screenwriter and film critic. In the 1940s, he was one of the most influential film critics in the U.S. His autobiographical novel, A Death in the Family (1957), won the author a posthumous Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br /><i>Life</i><br />Agee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, at Highland Avenue and 15th Street (renamed James Agee Street in 1999) to Hugh James Agee and Laura Whitman Tyler. When Agee was six, his father died in an automobile accident. From the age of seven, he and his younger sister, Emma, were educated in boarding schools. The most influential of these was located near his mother's summer cottage two miles from Sewanee, Tennessee. Saint Andrews School for Mountain Boys was run by Episcopal monks affiliated with the Order of the Holy Cross, and it was there that Agee's lifelong friendship with an Episcopal priest, Father James Harold Flye, began in 1919. As Agee's close friend and spiritual confidant, Flye was the recipient of many of Agee's most revealing letters.<br /><br />Agee went to Knoxville High School for the 1924\u20131925 school year, then travelled with Father Flye to Europe. On their return, Agee moved to boarding school in New Hampshire, entering the class of 1928 at Phillips Exeter Academy. There, he was president of The Lantern Club and editor of the Monthly where his first short stories, plays, poetry and articles were published. Agee was admitted to Harvard University's class of 1932. He was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Advocate.<br /><br />In 1951 in Santa Barbara, Agee, a hard drinker and chain-smoker, suffered the first two in a series of heart attacks, which ultimately claimed his life four years later at the age of 45. He was buried on a farm he owned at Hillsdale, New York.<br /><br /><i>Career</i><br />After graduation, he wrote for Fortune and Time magazines, although he is better known for his later film criticism in The Nation. In 1934, he published his only volume of poetry, Permit Me Voyage.<br /><br />In the summer of 1936, Agee spent eight weeks on assignment for Fortune with photographer Walker Evans living among sharecroppers in Alabama. Agee turned the material into a book entitled, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941). It sold only 600 copies before being remaindered.<br /><br />In 1942, Agee became the film critic for Time and, at one point, reviewed up to six films per week. Together, he and friend Whittaker Chambers ran \"the back of the book\" for Time. He left to become film critic for The Nation. In 1948, however, he quit both magazines to become a freelance writer. One of his assignments was a well-received article for Life Magazine about the great silent movie comedians, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon, which has been credited for reviving Keaton's career. As a freelance in the 1950s, he continued to write magazine articles while working on movie scripts, often with photographer Helen Levitt.<br /><br />Agee was an ardent champion of Charlie Chaplin's then extremely unpopular film Monsieur Verdoux (1947), which has since become a film classic. He was also a great admirer of Laurence Olivier's Henry V and Hamlet, especially Henry V, for which he actually published three separate reviews, all of which have been printed in the collection Agee on Film.<br /><br /><i>Legacy</i><br />Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, ignored on its original publication in 1941, has been placed among the greatest literary works of the 20th Century by the New York School of Journalism and the New York Public Library.",

He was interested in the enhancement of individual and cultural health, and believed in life, creativity, power, and the realities of the world we live in, rather than those situated in a world beyond. Central to his philosophy is the idea of \u201clife-affirmation,\u201d which involves an honest questioning of all doctrines that drain life's expansive energies, however socially prevalent those views might be. Often referred to as one of the first existentialist philosophers along with S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855), Nietzsche's revitalizing philosophy has inspired leading figures in all walks of cultural life, including dancers, poets, novelists, painters, psychologists, philosophers, sociologists and social revolutionaries.<br /><br />From the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>",

        "biography": "From author's website:<br /><br />People are always asking me questions I don't have answers for. One is, \"When did you first know that you wanted to become a writer?\" The fact is that I never wanted to be a writer, at least not when I was a child, or even a young woman. Today I want very much to be a writer. But when I was ten, I wanted to be either a movie star or a missionary. When I was twenty, I wanted to get married and have lots of children.<br /><br />Another question I can't answer is, \"When did you begin writing?\" I can't remember. I know I began reading when I was four or five, because I couldn't stand not being able to. I must have tried writing soon afterward. Fortunately, very few samples of my early writing survived the eighteen moves I made before I was eighteen years old. I say fortunately, because the samples that did manage to survive are terrible, with the single exception of a rather nice letter I wrote to my father when I was seven. We were living in Shanghai, and my father was working in our old home territory, which at the time was across various battle lines. I missed him very much, and in telling him so, I managed a piece of writing I am not ashamed of to this day.<br /><br /><br />A lot has happened to me since I wrote that letter. The following year, we had to refugee a second time because war between Japan and the United States seemed inevitable. During World War II, we lived in Virginia and North Carolina, and when our family's return to China was indefinitely postponed, we moved to various towns in North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, before my parents settled in Winchester, Virginia.<br /><br />By that time, I was ready to begin college. I spent four years at King College in Bristol, Tennessee, doing what I loved best-reading English and American literature-and avoiding math whenever possible.<br /><br />My dream of becoming a movie star never came true, but I did a lot of acting all through school, and the first writing for which I got any applause consisted of plays I wrote for my sixth-grade friends to act out.<br /><br />On the way to becoming a missionary, I spent a year teaching in a rural school in northern Virginia, where almost all my children were like Jesse Aarons. I'll never forget that wonderful class. A teacher I once met at a meeting in Virginia told me that when she read Bridge to Terabithia to her class, one of the girls told her that her mother had been in that Lovettsville sixth grade. I am very happy that those children, now grown up with children of their own, know about the book. I hope they can tell by reading it how much they meant to me.<br /><br /><br />After Lovettsville, I spent two years in graduate school in Richmond, Virginia, studying Bible and Christian education; then I went to Japan. My childhood dream was, of course, to be a missionary to China and eat Chinese food three times a day. But China was closed to Americans in 1957, and a Japanese friend urged me to go to Japan instead. I remembered the Japanese as the enemy. They were the ones who dropped the bombs and then occupied the towns where I had lived as a child. I was afraid of the Japanese, and so I hated them. But my friend persuaded me to put aside those childish feelings and give myself a chance to view the Japanese in a new way.<br /><br />If you've read my early books, you must know that I came to love Japan and feel very much at home there. I went to language school, and lived and worked in that country for four years. I had every intention of spending the rest of my life among the Japanese. But when I returned to the States for a year of study in New York, I met a young Presbyterian pastor who changed the direction of my life once again. We were married in 1962.<br /><br />I suppose my life as a writer really began in 1964. The Presbyterian church asked me to write some curriculum materials for fifth- and sixth-graders. Since the church had given me a scholarship to study and I had married instead of going back to work in Japan, I felt I owed them something for their m",

        "biography": "Wolfram von Eschenbach (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1220) was a German knight and poet, regarded as one of the greatest epic poets of his time. As a Minnesinger, he also wrote lyric poetry.<br /><br />Little is known of Wolfram's life. There are no historical documents which mention him, and his works are the sole source of evidence. In Parzival he talks of wir Beier (\"we Bavarians\") and the dialect of his works is East Franconian. This and a number of geographical references have resulted in the present-day Wolframs-Eschenbach, previously Obereschenbach, near Ansbach in Bavaria, being officially designated as his birthplace. However, the evidence is circumstantial and not without problems - there are at least four other places named Eschenbach in present-day Bavaria, and Wolframs-Eschenbach was not part of Bavaria in Wolfram's time.[citation needed]<br /><br />The arms shown in the Manesse manuscript come from the imagination of a 14th-century artist, drawing on the figure of the Red Knight in Parzival, and have no heraldic connection with Wolfram.<br /><br />Wolfram's work indicates a number of possible patrons (most reliably Hermann I of Thuringia), which suggests that he served at a number of courts during his life. In his Parzival he claims he is illiterate and recorded the work by dictation, though the claim is treated with scepticism by scholars.<br /><br />Wolfram is best known today for his Parzival, sometimes regarded as the greatest of all German epics from that time. Based on Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes' Perceval, le Conte du Graal, it is the first extant work in German to have as its subject the Holy Grail. In the poem, Wolfram's narrator expresses disdain for Chr\u00e9tien's (unfinished) version of the tale, and states that his source was a poet from Provence called Kyot. Some scholars believe Wolfram might have meant Guiot de Provins (though none of the latter's surviving works relate to the themes of Parzival), however others believe Kyot was simply a literary device invented by Wolfram to explain his deviations from Chr\u00e9tien's version.<br /><br />Wolfram is the author of two other narrative works: the unfinished Willehalm and the fragmentary Titurel. These were both composed after Parzival, and Titurel mentions the death of Hermann I, which dates it firmly after 1217. Wolfram's nine surviving songs, five of which are dawn-songs, are regarded as masterpieces of Minnesang.",

        "biography": "Born in 1911 in R\u0103\u0219inari, a small village in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania, raised under the rule of a father who was a Romanian Orthodox priest and a mother who was prone to depression, Emil Cioran wrote his first five books in Romanian. Some of these are collections of brief essays (one or two pages, on average); others are collections of aphorisms. Suffering from insomnia since his adolescent years in Sibiu, the young Cioran studied philosophy in the \u201clittle Paris\u201d of Bucarest. A prolific publicist, he became a well-known figure, along with Mircea Eliade, Constantin No\u00efca, and his future close friend Eugene Ionesco (with whom he shared the Royal Foundation\u2019s Young Writers Prize in 1934 for his first book, On the Heights of Despair). <br /><br />Influenced by the German romantics, by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and the Lebensphilosophie of Schelling and Bergson, by certain Russian writers, including Chestov, Rozanov, and Dostoyevsky, and by the Romanian poet Eminescu, Cioran wrote lyrical and expansive meditations that were often metaphysical in nature and whose recurrent themes were death, despair, solitude, history, music, saintliness and the mystics (cf. Tears and Saints, 1937) \u2013 all of which are themes that one finds again in his French writings. In his highly controversial book, The Transfiguration of Romania (1937), Cioran, who was at that time close to the Romanian fascists, violently criticized his country and his compatriots on the basis of a contrast between such \u201clittle nations\u201d as Romania, which were contemptible from the perspective of universal history and great nations, such as France or Germany, which took their destiny into their own hands. <br /><br />After spending two years in Germany, Cioran arrived in Paris in 1936. He continued to write in Romanian until the early 1940s (he wrote his last article in Romanian in 1943, which is also the year in which he began writing in French). The break with Romanian became definitive in 1946, when, in the course of translating Mallarm\u00e9, he suddenly decided to give up his native tongue since no one spoke it in Paris. He then began writing in French a book that, thanks to numerous intensive revisions, would eventually become the impressive A Short History of Decay (1949) -- the first of a series of ten books in which Cioran would continue to explore his perennial obsessions, with a growing detachment that allies him equally with the Greek sophists, the French moralists, and the oriental sages. He wrote existential vituperations and other destructive reflections in a classical French style that he felt was diametrically opposed to the looseness of his native Romanian; he described it as being like a \u201cstraight-jacket\u201d that required him to control his temperamental excesses and his lyrical flights. The books in which he expressed his radical disillusionment appeared, with decreasing frequency, over a period of more than three decades, during which time he shared his solitude with his companion Simone Bou\u00e9 in a miniscule garret in the center of Paris, where he lived as a spectator more and more turned in on himself and maintaining an ever greater distance from a world that he rejected as much on the historical level (History and Utopia, 1960) as on the ontological (The Fall into Time, 1964), raising his misanthropy to heights of subtlety (The Trouble with being Born, 1973), while also allowing to appear from time to time a humanism composed of irony, bitterness, and preciosity (Exercices d\u2019admiration, 1986, and the posthumously published Notebooks). <br /><br />Denied the right to return to Romania during the years of the communist regime, and attracting international attention only late in his career, Cioran died in Paris in 1995. <br /><br />Nicolas Cavaill\u00e8s <br />Translated by Thomas Cousineau",

I think it's something to do with being born in sight of the ocean. Or possibly with the fact that almost no one admits to being from Ontario\u2026<br /><br />Raised, for the most part, in Kingston, Ontario. It was the late sixties, early to mid seventies. Enough said for those of us who lived through it-and those who didn't seem to be getting another chance to fall off platform shoes.<br /><br />Spent three years in the Canadian Naval Reserve: I was a cook. They'd just opened it up to women and I figured it would be the first trade that would send women to sea. I was right. Unfortunately it happened a year after I left. No tattoos.<br /><br />Received a degree in RADIO AND TELEVISION ARTS (B.A.A.) from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute: The year I graduated was the year that the CBC laid off 750 employees in Toronto alone. We were competing for jobs with people who had up to five years experience. The cat threw up on my degree.<br /><br />Spent eight years working at Bakka, North America's oldest surviving science fiction book store: Change Of Hobbit in California was actually a very little bit older but unfortunately it was a casualty of the recession in '91. During those eight years, while working full-time, I wrote seven books (the first seven, except for the original draft of CHILD), and nine short stories.<br /><br />In 1992, after living in downtown Toronto, a city of nearly three million, for thirteen years, I moved with two large cats, one small psychotic cat, and my partner out to a rented house in the middle of nowhere. In the years since, we've purchased the house, buried two of the original cats, replaced them with three more felines and, unintentionally, acquired a Chihuahua. You're probably wondering how two reasonably intelligent adults can unintentionally acquire a Chihuahua. Please don't ask.<br /><br />I love living in the country, writing full-time, anything by Charles de Lint, Xena, Hercules, and email. I dislike telephones, electric blankets, and bathroom renovations.<br /><br />I always expect catastrophe; as a result, I'm usually pleasantly surprised.\"<br /><br />Huff lives with her wife, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/69803.Fiona_Patton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fiona Patton</a>.",

Book I would have taken to a desert island: Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery.<br /><br />Education:<br />BA in English, Oberlin College, Ohio, 1984. No one was surprised that I went there; I was made for such a progressive, liberal place.<br /><br />MA in creative writing, University of East Anglia, Norwich, England, 1994. There\u2019s a lot of debate about whether or not you can be taught to write. Why doesn\u2019t anyone ask that of professional singers, painters, dancers? That year forced me to write all the time and take it seriously.<br /><br />Geography:<br />Moved to London after graduating from Oberlin in 1984. I had studied for a semester in London and thought it was a great place, so came over for fun, expecting to go back to the US after 6 months to get serious. I\u2019m still in London, and still not entirely serious. Even have dual citizenship \u2013 though I keep the American accent intact.<br /><br />Family:<br />1 English husband + 1 English son + 1 tortoiseshell cat.<br /><br />Career:<br />Before writing, was a reference book editor, working on encyclopedias about writers. (Yup, still nerdy.) Learned how to research and how to make sentences better. Eventually I wanted to fix my own sentences rather than others\u2019, so I quit and did the MA.<br /><br />Writing:<br />Talked a lot about becoming a writer as a kid, but actual pen to paper contact was minimal. Started writing short stories in my 20s, then began first novel, The Virgin Blue, during the MA year. With Girl With a Pearl Earring (written in 1998), I became a full-time writer, and have since juggled it with motherhood",

He never took drawing seriously until he was 17; after reading Dragon Ball he knew he wanted to be a manga artist. At the age of 18 he submitted his first concept for the series Zombiepowder but it got rejected. Zombiepowder was rejected multiple times until Kubo was 22, when it finally was accepted by Shonen Jump. It did not last long; it was cancelled after four volumes in late 2000.<br /><br />His next series, Bleach, about a high school student who becomes a shinigami and fights hollows, was not such a failure. Bleach began regular publication in 2001. It has been running in Weekly Shonen Jump ever since.",

Defoe is notable for being one of the earliest practitioners of the novel and helped popularize the genre in Britain. In some texts he is even referred to as one of the founders, if not the founder, of the English novel. A prolific and versatile writer, he wrote more than five hundred books, pamphlets, and journals on various topics (including politics, crime, religion, marriage, psychology and the supernatural). He was also a pioneer of economic journalism.",

For a period of nearly fifty years, the prevailing theory was that the author's true identity was Daniel Defoe, author of Robinson Crusoe. But that theory has been challenged and invalidated based on a lack of supporting evidence. Nonetheless, his book, which is in the public domain, has been published in a large number of editions by various publishers and in translations around the world, often employing the name Daniel Defoe on the cover.",

When the Berlin Wall fell, he walked from Poland to Istanbul to encounter the new European neighbours. His account of the journey, On Foot to the Golden Horn, won the John Llewellyn Rhys/Mail on Sunday Prize in 1993.<br /><br />Fascinated by what he had learned of Istanbul's perpetual influence in the region, he wrote Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire, a New York Times Notable Book. 'If you want to learn,' he says, 'write a book.' Lords of the Horizons was described by Time Out as 'perhaps the most readable history ever written on anything.'<br /><br />Having always wanted to write fiction, he became popular as the author of the mystery series beginning with The Janissary Tree, which won the coveted Edgar Award for Best Novel in 2007. Translated into more than 40 languages, the series continues with The Snake Stone, The Bellini Card, An Evil Eye and The Baklava Club. They feature a Turkish detective, Yashim, who lives in 19th century Istanbul. <br /><br />YASHIM COOKS ISTANBUL is an illustrated collection of recipes, inspired by the cookery in his five published adventures.",

        "biography": "\"The name of Charles Neider is familiar to everyone in the field of Mark Twain studies. Born in 1915, he did most of his work on Mark Twain between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s. <br /><br />A man of many parts, Neider would make an interesting study in his own right. He was born in Odessa, Russia, on January 18, 1915 and came to the United States in 1920. After graduating from City College of New York in 1938, he became a free-lance writer and editor. His writings would eventually range from a book on insects to several books on Antarctica, which he visited three times between 1969 and 1977. That remote continent was one of his chief passions, and he is probably better known for his books about it than he is for his Mark Twain books. He also wrote novels and published collections of such classic writers as Washington Irving and Leo Tolstoy. He spent his last years fighting against the cancer that eventually killed him; and before he died, he completed Adam's Burden: An Explorer's Personal Odyssey Through Prostate Cancer, which is scheduled for publication in October.<br /><br />While researching the Western novel he published as The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones (later made into the Marlon Brando film One-eyed Jacks). In 1957 he published his first Mark Twain collection, The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain.<br /><br />Neider followed with other collections that covered the gamut of Mark Twain writings: The Complete Humorous Sketches and Tales of Mark Twain (1961), Mark Twain: Life As I Find It: Essays, Sketches, Tales and Other Material (1961), Complete Essays of Mark Twain (1963), The Travels of Mark Twain (1961), The Complete Novels of Mark Twain (1964), The Complete Travel Books of Mark Twain (2 volumes, 1966), The Comic Mark Twain Reader (1977), The Selected Letters of Mark Twain (1982), Plymouth Rock and the Pilgrims and Other Salutary Platform Opinions (1984), Mark Twain at His Best: A Comprehensive Sampler (1986) and The Outrageous Mark Twain (1987). Through those years, his books helped remind the world that Mark Twain wrote much more than Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.<br /><br />Neider's most important book, however, was arguably The Autobiography of Mark Twain (1959). In 1965, he published The Adventures of Colonel Sellers, in which he condensed all of Charles Dudley Warner's chapters to brief interchapter passages, in the same way (as Neider pointed out) that Mark Twain himself had constructed \"Those Extraordinary Twins\" out of the original draft of Pudd'nhead Wilson. <br /><br />The best summary of Neider's Mark Twain work can be found in his elegantly written 1967 book titled, simply, Mark Twain, which collected the introductions to his earlier books, along with other essays, including the well-known \"Mark Twain and the Russians: An Exchange of Views\" (1960).\" by Kent Rassmussen, abridged <br />Source - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.citadel.edu/leonard/js01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://faculty.citadel.edu/leonard/js...</a><br /><br /><br />",

They were unable to return to Afghanistan because of the Saur Revolution in which the PDPA communist party seized power through a bloody coup in April 1978. Instead, a year after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in 1980 they sought political asylum in the United States and made their residence in San Jose, California.<br />Hosseini graduated from Independence High School in San Jose in 1984 and enrolled at Santa Clara University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1988. The following year, he entered the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. in 1993. He completed his residency in internal medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 1996. He practiced medicine for over ten years, until a year and a half after the release of The Kite Runner.<br />Hosseini is currently a Goodwill Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He has been working to provide humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan through the Khaled Hosseini Foundation. The concept for the foundation was inspired by the trip to Afghanistan that Hosseini made in 2007 with UNHCR.<br />He lives in Northern California with his wife, Roya, and their two children (Harris and Farah).",

She has influenced such writers as Stephen King, Nigel Kneale, and Richard Matheson.<br /><br />She is best known for her dystopian short story, \"The Lottery\" (1948), which suggests there is a deeply unsettling underside to bucolic, smalltown America. In her critical biography of Shirley Jackson, Lenemaja Friedman notes that when Shirley Jackson's story \"The Lottery\" was published in the June 28, 1948, issue of <i>The New Yorker</i>, it received a response that \"no <i>New Yorker</i> story had ever received.\" Hundreds of letters poured in that were characterized by, as Jackson put it, \"bewilderment, speculation and old-fashioned abuse.\"<br /><br />Jackson's husband, the literary critic Stanley Edgar Hyman, wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that \"she consistently refused to be interviewed, to explain or promote her work in any fashion, or to take public stands and be the pundit of the Sunday supplements. She believed that her books would speak for her clearly enough over the years.\" Hyman insisted the darker aspects of Jackson's works were not, as some critics claimed, the product of \"personal, even neurotic, fantasies\", but that Jackson intended, as \"a sensitive and faithful anatomy of our times, fitting symbols for our distressing world of the concentration camp and the Bomb\", to mirror humanity's Cold War-era fears. Jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work, as revealed by Hyman's statement that she \"was always proud that the Union of South Africa banned <i>The Lottery</i>', and she felt that they at least understood the story\".<br /><br />In 1965, Jackson died of heart failure in her sleep, at her home in North Bennington Vermont, at the age of 48. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",

        "biography": "Photographer and writer, Randy Leffingwell, has more than 35 books in print, primarily on Americana subjects. These cover interests and areas as diverse as the American barn and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, California\u2019s wine country and John Deere farm tractors. His awareness of and attraction to moving things goes back as far as he can remember, to the first Dinky Toys and Match Box cars his father and mother gave him. His practical introduction to real sports cars came several years later when his uncle took him to watch a weekend of racing events at Meadowdale International Raceway in suburban Chicago.<br /><br />Throughout all this time, however, he imagined himself becoming an architect and his life-long admiration of buildings and design began with frequent trips to downtown Chicago. While in undergraduate studies at Kansas University in the architectural engineering sequence, he discovered photography, journalism, and reawakened an earlier passion for writing. He scarcely looked back as he shifted his major studies from architecture, through English, Art History, psychology, and finally to the William Allen White school of Journalism for a BS in photojournalism.<br /><br />Following graduation from KU, Randy began a successful career as a photojournalist first at the Kansas City TIMES, then joining the staff of the Chicago SUN-TIMES where he remained for nine years. He then worked as associate editor at AutoWeek magazine in Detroit, before being hired by the Los Angeles TIMES as a writer/photographer. He worked for the TIMES for 11 years, covering everything from news stories to personality profiles to food features throughout Italy, film festivals in France and Utah, and live theater in London. It was, he says, a great job and a great place to work.<br /><br />His latest project is a large history of Harley-Davidson for them. During this project, he photographed 193 motorcycles from the Harley-Davidson Archives Collection and he completed the corresponding text for the book in early April 2007. Release of this 432 page book tentatively is scheduled for early 2008. <br /><br />",

        "biography": "Thomas Sowell is an American economist, social commentator, and author of dozens of books. He often writes from an economically laissez-faire perspective. He is currently a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. In 1990, he won the Francis Boyer Award, presented by the American Enterprise Institute. In 2002 he was awarded the National Humanities Medal for prolific scholarship melding history, economics, and political science.<br /><br />Sowell was born in North Carolina, where, he recounted in his autobiography, A Personal Odyssey, his encounters with Caucasians were so limited he didn't believe that \"yellow\" was a hair color. He moved to Harlem, New York City with his mother's sister (whom he believed was his mother); his father had died before he was born. Sowell went to Stuyvesant High School, but dropped out at 17 because of financial difficulties and a deteriorating home environment. He worked at various jobs to support himself, including in a machine shop and as a delivery man for Western Union. He applied to enter the Civil Service and was eventually accepted, moving to Washington DC. He was drafted in 1951, during the Korean War, and assigned to the US Marine Corps. Due to prior experience in photography, he worked in a photography unit.<br /><br />After his discharge, Sowell passed the GED examination and enrolled at Howard University. He transfered to Harvard University, where he graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics. He received a Master of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, and a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics from the University of Chicago. Sowell initially chose Columbia University because he wanted to study under George Stigler. After arriving at Columbia and learning that Stigler had moved to Chicago, he followed him there.<br /><br />Sowell has taught Economics at Howard University, Cornell University, Brandeis University, and UCLA. Since 1980 he has been a Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he holds a fellowship named after Rose and Milton Friedman.<br /><br />",

They married in London but lived in Berlin and eventually moved to the countryside where, in Nassenheide, Pomerania, the von Arnims had their family estate. The couple had five children, four daughters and a son. The children's tutors at Nassenheide included E. M. Forster and Hugh Walpole.<br /><br />In 1898 she started her literary career by publishing Elizabeth and Her German Garden, a semi-autobiographical novel about a rural idyll published anonymously and, as it turned out to be highly successful, reprinted 21 times within the first year. Von Arnim wrote another 20 books, which were all published \"By the author of Elizabeth and Her German Garden\".<br /><br />Count von Arnim died in 1910, and in 1916 Elizabeth married John Francis Stanley Russell, 2nd Earl Russell, Bertrand Russell's elder brother. The marriage ended in disaster, with Elizabeth escaping to the United States and the couple finally agreeing, in 1919, to get a divorce. She also had an affair with H. G. Wells.<br /><br />She was a cousin of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45712.Katherine_Mansfield\" title=\"Katherine Mansfield\" rel=\"nofollow\">Katherine Mansfield</a> (whose full name was Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp).<br />Elizabeth von Arnim spent her old age in London, Switzerland, and on the French Riviera. When World War II broke out she permanently took up residence in the United States, where she died in 1941, aged 74.",

His writings deal mainly with life in his native Bosnia under the Ottoman Empire. His house in Travnik is now a Museum. His Belgrade flat on Andri\u0107ev Venac hosts the Museum of Ivo Andri\u0107 and the Ivo Andri\u0107 Foundation.<br /><br />After the Second World War, he spent most of his time in his Belgrade home, held ceremonial posts in the Communist government of Yugoslavia and was a Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentarian. He was also a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.<br /><br /> In 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \"for the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from the history of his country\". He donated the prize money to libraries in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br /><br />His works include <i>The Bridge on the Drina</i>, <i>Bosnian Chronicle</i> (aka <i>Chronicles of Travnik</i>), and <i>The Woman from Sarajevo</i>. These were written during WW2 while he was living quietly in Belgrade and published in 1945. They are often referred to as the \"Bosnian Trilogy\" as they were published simultaneously and had been written in the same period.

        "biography": "I was born in Connecticut in 1973, during a brief blip in my family's otherwise western U.S. existence. We were settled in Phoenix by the time I was four, and I think of myself as a native. The unusual spelling of my name was a gift from my father, Stephen (+ ie = me). Though I have had my name spelled wrong on pretty much everything my entire life long, I must admit that it makes it easier to Google myself now.<br /><br />I filled the \"Jan Brady\" spot in my family--the second of three girls; however, unlike the Bradys, none of my three brothers are steps, and all of them are younger than all the girls. I went to high school in Scottsdale, Arizona, the kind of place where every fall a few girls would come back to school with new noses and there were Porsches in the student lot. (For the record, I have my original nose and never had a car until I was in my twenties.) I was awarded a National Merit Scholarship, and I used it to pay my way to Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah. I majored in English but concentrated on literature rather than creative writing, mostly because I didn't consider reading books \"work.\" (As long as I was going to be doing something anyway, I might as well get course credit for it, right?)<br /><br />I met my husband, Pancho (his real name is Christiaan), when I was four, but we were never anywhere close to being childhood sweethearts; in fact, though we saw each other at least weekly through church activities, I can't recall a single instance when we so much as greeted each other with a friendly wave, let alone exchanged actual words. This may have been for the best, because when we did eventually get around to exchanging words, sixteen years after our first meeting, it only took nine months from the first \"hello\" to the wedding; of course, we were able to skip over a lot of the getting-to-know you parts. (Many of our conversations would go something like this: \"This one time, when I was ten, I broke my hand at a party when--\" \"Yeah. I know what happened. I was there, remember?\") We've been married for ten-and-a-half years now and have three beautiful, brilliant, wonderful boys who often remind me of chimpanzees on crack. I can't write without music, and my biggest muse is, ironically enough, the band Muse. My other favorite sources of inspiration are Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Coldplay, The All American Rejects, Travis, The Strokes, Brand New, U2, Kasabian, Jimmy Eat World, and Weezer, to mention a few.",

        "biography": "Tatian the Assyrian (c. 120 \u2013 c. 180 AD) was an Assyrian early Christian writer and theologian of the 2nd century.<br /><br />Tatian's most influential work is the Diatessaron, a Biblical paraphrase, or \"harmony\", of the four gospels that became the standard text of the four gospels in the Syriac-speaking churches until the 5th-century, when it gave way to the four separate gospels in the Peshitta version<br /><br />Concerning the date and place of his birth, little is known beyond what he tells about himself in his Oratio ad Graecos, chap. xlii (Ante-Nicene Fathers, ii. 81\u201382): that he was born in \"the land of the Assyrians\"; current scholarly consensus is that he died c. 185 AD, perhaps in Assyria.<br /><br />He came to Rome, where he seems to have remained for some time. Here he seems to have for the first time encountered Christianity. According to his own representation, it was primarily his abhorrence of the pagan cults that led him to spend thought on religious problems. By the Old Testament, he says, he was convinced of the unreasonableness of paganism. He adopted the Christian religion and became the pupil of Justin Martyr. It was the period when Christian philosophers competed with Greek sophists, and like Justin, he opened a Christian school in Rome. It is not known how long he labored in Rome without being disturbed.<br /><br />Following the death of Justin in 165 AD, the life of Tatian is to some extent obscure. Irenaeus remarks (Haer., I., xxvlii. 1, Ante-Nicene Fathers, i. 353) that after the death of Justin, he was expelled from the church for his Encratitic (ascetic) views (Eusebius claims he founded the Encratitic sect), as well as for being a follower of the gnostic leader Valentinius. It is clear that Tatian left Rome, perhaps to reside for a while in either Greece or Alexandria, where he may have taught Clement.[citation needed] Epiphanius relates that Tatian established a school in Mesopotamia, the influence of which extended to Antioch in Syria, and was felt in Cilicia and especially in Pisidia.<br /><br />The early development of the Syrian church furnishes a commentary on the attitude of Tatian in practical life. Thus for Aphraates baptism conditions the taking of a vow in which the catechumen promises celibacy. This shows how firmly the views of Tatian were established in Syria, and it supports the supposition that Tatian was the missionary of the countries around the Euphrates.",

Descended from contract laborers from Portugal and Norway and a mechanic from Italy, he was born in the working-class neighborhood of Kaka\u02bbako. His friends and classmates in the area were Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Hawaiian, and \"hapa-haole\" [part-white], so he grew up \"local,\" mastering Hawaiian \"pidgin\" as well as English as his novels attest. As a youngster he developed a love for the cultures of Hawai`i as well as literature and classical music. He graduated in 1934 from the University of Hawaii, where he served as student body president. By 1937 he had earned both his MS and PhD degrees in bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin and later worked and taught (1937\u201340) at George Washington University Medical School in Washington D.C. He returned to Hawai`i in 1940 working for the Department of Health on Kaua`i and Maui before joining the U.S Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Following the war he taught at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, retiring in 1970 as emeritus professor of medical microbiology and medical history. He served as editor in chief of the journal Pacific Science from 1957 through 1967. Married to Elizabeth Jane Krauskopf in 1943, he had two sons, Andrew and Philip and a daughter, Mahealani.<br /><br />Bushnell's first novel, The Return of Lono, won the Atlantic Monthly's fiction award in 1956, at a time when most books about Hawai\u02bbi were written by outsiders. Later novels dealt with other aspects of Hawai\u02bbi's history and he encouraged and inspired many other local writers to tell their own stories. Moloka\u02bbi (1975) tells the story of leprosy patients quarantined at Kalaupapa; Ka\u02bba\u02bbawa (1972) describes life on O\u02bbahu in the 1850s, during the great smallpox epidemic when many native Hawaiians were dying of newly introduced diseases; and Stone of Kannon (1979) and its sequel Water of Kane tell about the first Japanese contract laborers who arrived in 1868. In 1974, the Hawai\u02bbi Literary Arts Council presented him an Award for Literature, saying he \"brought life to fact and reality to fiction.\"<br /><br />His historical works include \"Hawaii: A Pictorial History\" (1969) with Joseph Feher and Edward Joesting, \"A Walk Through Old Honolulu\" (1975), and \"A Song of Pilgrimage and Exile: The Life and Spirit of Mother Marianne of Molokai\" (1980) with Sister Mary Laurence Hanley, O.S.F.<br /><br />His last work, Gifts of Civilization: Germs and Genocide in Hawaii (1993), combined his interests in microbiology, Hawaiian history, and literature. It remains the definitive study of how Native Hawaiians, having lived in isolation for centuries, were very nearly wiped out by exposure to newly introduced diseases such as tuberculosis, smallpox, and leprosy.",

Thus he became Tibet's most important political ruler just one month after the People's Republic of China's invasion of Tibet on 7 October 1950. In 1954, he went to Beijing to attempt peace talks with Mao Zedong and other leaders of the PRC. These talks ultimately failed.<br /><br />After a failed uprising and the collapse of the Tibetan resistance movement in 1959, the Dalai Lama left for India, where he was active in establishing the Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan Government in Exile) and in seeking to preserve Tibetan culture and education among the thousands of refugees who accompanied him.<br /><br />Tenzin Gyatso is a charismatic figure and noted public speaker. This Dalai Lama is the first to travel to the West. There, he has helped to spread Buddhism and to promote the concepts of universal responsibility, secular ethics, and religious harmony.<br /><br />He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, honorary Canadian citizenship in 2006, and the United States Congressional Gold Medal on 17 October 2007.<br />",

He also taught English in Colombia, an experience which determined the style and setting of his first three novels, The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts (1990), Se\u00f1or Vivo and the Coca Lord (1991) and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman (1992), each of which was heavily influenced by South American literature, particularly 'magic realism'.<br /><br />In 1993, he was selected as one of the 20 'Best of Young British Novelists 2' promotion in Granta magazine. His fourth novel, Corelli's Mandolin, was published in the following year, winning the Commonwealth Writers Prize (Best Book). It was also shortlisted for the Sunday Express Book of the Year. Set on the Greek island of Cephalonia during the Second World War, the novel tells the story of a love affair between the daughter of a local doctor and an Italian soldier. It has become a worldwide bestseller and has now been translated into over 30 languages. A film adaptation of the novel was released in 2001, and the novel has also been adapted for the stage. In 2001, Red Dog was published - a collection of stories inspired by a statue of a dog encountered on a trip to a writers' festival in Australia in 1998.<br /><br /><br />Prizes and awards<br />1991 Commonwealth Writers Prize (Eurasia Region, Best First Book) The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts<br />1992 Commonwealth Writers Prize (Eurasia Region, Best Book) Se\u00f1or Vivo and the Coca Lord<br />1994 Sunday Express Book of the Year (shortlist) Corelli's Mandolin<br />1995 Commonwealth Writers Prize (Overall Winner, Best Book) Corelli's Mandolin<br />1995 Lannan Literary Award (Fiction)<br />1997 British Book Awards Author of the Year<br />2004 Whitbread Novel Award (shortlist) Birds Without Wings<br />2005 Commonwealth Writers Prize (Eurasia Region, Best Book) (shortlist) Birds Without Wings<br /><br /><br /> \t\t.<br />\t\tTop of page\t<br />",

She flourished at Catholic schools and earned a physiology degree from the University of New South Wales in 1963. Planning become a doctor, she found that she had a violent allergy to hospital soap and turned instead to neurophysiology \u2013 the study of the nervous system's functions. She found jobs first in London and then at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. <br /><br />After her beloved younger brother Carl died in 1965 at age 25 while rescuing two drowning women in the waters off Crete, a shattered McCullough quit writing. She finally returned to her craft in 1974 with <i>Tim</i>, a critically acclaimed novel about the romance between a female executive and a younger, mentally disabled gardener. As always, the author proved her toughest critic: \"Actually,\" she said, \"it was an icky book, saccharine sweet.\" <br /><br />A year later, while on a paltry $10,000 annual salary as a Yale researcher, McCullough \u2013 just \"Col\" to her friends \u2013 began work on the sprawling <i>The Thorn Birds</i>, about the lives and loves of three generations of an Australian family. Many of its details were drawn from her mother's family's experience as migrant workers, and one character, Dane, was based on brother Carl. <br /><br />Though some reviews were scathing, millions of readers worldwide got caught up in her tales of doomed love and other natural calamities. The paperback rights sold for an astonishing $1.9 million. <br /><br />In all, McCullough wrote 11 novels.<br /><br />Source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.people.com/article/colleen-mccullough-thorn-birds-author-dies\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.people.com/article/colleen...</a><br />",

Graduation in 1968 found him with a BA in political science and a draft notice.<br /><br />O'Brien was against the war but reported for service and was sent to Vietnam with what has been called the \"unlucky\" Americal division due to its involvement in the My Lai massacre in 1968, an event which figures prominently in In the Lake of the Woods. He was assigned to 3rd Platoon, A Company, 5th Battalion, 46th Infantry, as an infantry foot soldier. O'Brien's tour of duty was 1969-70.<br /><br />After Vietnam he became a graduate student at Harvard. No doubt he was one of very few Vietnam veterans there at that time, much less Combat Infantry Badge (CIB) holders. Having the opportunity to do an internship at the Washington Post, he eventually left Harvard to become a newspaper reporter. O'Brien's career as a reporter gave way to his fiction writing after publication of his memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Send Me Home.<br /><br />Tim O'Brien is now a visiting professor and endowed chair at Texas State University - San Marcos (formerly Southwest Texas State University) where he teaches in the Creative Writing Program. <br />",

So many words to choose from! So many different things that could happen in a story at any moment!

So far, she has written four novels, six books of nonfiction, and quite a few essays and stories.<br /><br />Jeanne DuPrau doesn't write every minute of every day. She also putters around in her garden. She lives in California, where it's easy to grow everything from apples to zinnias.<br /><br />Jeanne DuPrau doesn't have children, but she has two nephews, a niece, and a dog. The dog lives with her. His name is Ethan. Jeanne and Ethan get along well, though their interests are different. Ethan is not very fond of reading, for example, and Jeanne doesn't much like chasing squirrels. But they agree on walks, naps, and trips in the car to surprise destinations. Ethan also likes to help in the garden.",

I can write one of these.\" Yeah right!<br /><br />Oh, she wrote several all right--twenty-one to be exact--but getting them published proved to be another matter. Throughout the years, she realized it was not an easy task to write a book, much less a short, concise one. Oh how wrong Lori was!<br /><br />However, now as an award-winning author, Lori is multi-published with twenty-one books currently sold in which her humor lends itself to her comedic voice. She writes contemporary novels and often uses her military, medical, or a combination of both backgrounds in her plots.<br /><br />Recently Lori has found her niche writing her new series, The Pauline Sokol Mysteries. Her ex-RN character, Pauline Sokol, becomes a medical insurance fraud investigator. Now she is working on a new series called \"Lethal in Lace.\" Yikes! Stay tuned for details.<br /><br />As an Air Force veteran, Lori belongs to RomVets and The Nathan Hale Chapter of Military Officers Association. As a writer, she belongs to The Author's Guild, Mystery Writers of America, Sisters in Crime, and Romance Writers of America along with several local chapters.<br /><br />Lori lives in the New England area, raising two sons (Heaven help her!), and, of course, continuing to write novels.

        "biography": "[From the author's own website]<br /><br />I was born and raised in New England and I live in Massachusetts now, with my husband and benevolent feline overlords. Mine is a quiet, fairly ordinary life. I love that because it's what saves me from an overdeveloped sense of paranoia and a tendency to expect the worst. Combined with an eye for detail and a quirky take on life, these traits give me a vivid internal life, one that's sometimes a little nerve-wracking, but very useful for writing mystery and suspense.<br /><br />My interest in archaeology stems from childhood, where my interest in books and the opportunities I had to travel made me begin to think about cultural differences. The thing I like best about this work is that it is a real opportunity to try and resurrect individuals from the monolith of history. I've worked on prehistoric and historical sites in the U.S. and in Europe, and like to teach, in the field, in museums, in the classroom, and through writing.<br /><br />In my first book, Site Unseen, my protagonist Emma Fielding discovers that archaeologists are trained to ask the same questions that detectives ask: who, what, where, when, how, and why. When I started on these books, I realized that archaeology is also good training for writing because research, logic, and persistence are so important to both endeavors. <br /><br />Naturally, that training worked with the archaeology mysteries--and it also helped with my first short story, \"The Lords of Misrule,\" a historical mystery which appeared in the anthology, Sugarplums and Scandal. But how has it worked when I've tackled subjects as seemingly diverse as werewolves (\"The Night Things Changed\" in Wolfsbane and Mistletoe and \"Swing Shift\" in Crimes By Moonlight) and noir (\"Femme Sole,\" in Boston Noir)? Easy: it's all about getting into someone else's shoes and walking around for a while. Preferably, getting into (fictional) trouble while you do it. Asking \"what if?\" and thinking about how culture and subcultures--in addition to personality--shape behavior.",

In the Ethics, \"Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely.\"<br /> Philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel said of all contemporary philosophers, \"You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all.\"",

        "biography": "Sharp was born in Ohio, the son of an itinerant Protestant minister. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences in 1949 from Ohio State University, where he also received his Master of Arts in Sociology in 1951. In 1953-54, Sharp was jailed for nine months after protesting the conscription of soldiers for the Korean War. In 1968, he received a Doctor of Philosophy in political theory from Oxford University.<br /><br />Sharp has been a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth since 1972. He simultaneously held research appointments at Harvard University\u2019s Center for International Affairs since 1965. In 1983 he founded the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide.<br />Sharp's contributions to the theory of nonviolent resistance<br />Question book-new.<br /><br />Gene Sharp described the sources of his ideas as in-depth studies of Mohandas K. Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau to a minor degree, and other sources footnoted in his 1973 book \"The Politics of Nonviolent Action\", which was based on his 1968 PhD thesis. In the book, a \"three-volume classic on civil disobedience,\" he provides a pragmatic political analysis of nonviolent action as a method for applying power in a conflict.<br /><br />Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state - regardless of its particular structural organization - ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power.<br /><br />In Sharp's view all effective power structures have systems by which they encourage or extract obedience from their subjects. States have particularly complex systems for keeping subjects obedient. These systems include specific institutions (police, courts, regulatory bodies) but may also involve cultural dimensions that inspire obedience by implying that power is monolithic (the god cult of the Egyptian pharaohs, the dignity of the office of the President, moral or ethical norms and taboos). Through these systems, subjects are presented with a system of sanctions (imprisonment, fines, ostracism) and rewards (titles, wealth, fame) which influence the extent of their obedience.<br /><br />Sharp identifies this hidden structure as providing a window of opportunity for a population to cause significant change in a state. Sharp cites the insight of E'tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie, that if the subjects of a particular state recognize that they are the source of the state's power they can refuse their obedience and their leader(s) will be left without power.<br /><br />Sharp published Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential in 2005. It builds on his earlier written works by documenting case studies where non violent action has been applied, and the lessons learned from those applications, and contains information on planning nonviolent struggle to make it more effective.<br /><br />For his lifelong commitment to the defense of freedom, democracy, and the reduction of political violence through scholarly analysis of the power of nonviolent action, The Peace Abbey of Sherborn, MA awarded him the Courage of Conscience award April 4, 2008.<br />Sharp's influence on struggles worldwide<br /><br />Sharp has been called both the \"Machiavelli of nonviolence\" and the \"Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.\" It is claimed by some that Sharp's scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. Most recently, it is claimed that the protest movement that toppled President Mubarak of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the youth movement in Tunisia and the earlier ones in the Eastern European color revolutions that had previously been inspired by Sharp's work, although some have cla",

Siendo joven viaj\u00f3 a la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico para estudiar literatura, coreograf\u00eda y teatro en la Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM).

Elena lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3 a Espa\u00f1a ese mismo a\u00f1o, regresando en 1938. Tuvieron una hija, Helena, y finalmente se divorciaron en 1959.<br /><br />A ra\u00edz de la masacre de Tlatelolco, en 1968, la prensa manipul\u00f3 sus declaraciones en las que ella supuestamente declaraba contra varios intelectuales mexicanos a los que responsabiliz\u00f3 de instigar a los estudiantes, para luego abandonarlos a su suerte. Estas acusaciones le ocasionaron el rechazo de la comunidad intelectual mexicana, lo que le llev\u00f3 al exilio primero en Estados Unidos y Espa\u00f1a, luego en Francia durante veinte a\u00f1os.<br /><br />Al regresar vivi\u00f3 en Cuernavaca con 37 gatos y su hija. El Conaculta cubri\u00f3 todos los gastos de su tratamiento contra el c\u00e1ncer de pulm\u00f3n, provocado por fumar desde su juventud. Finalmente, el c\u00e1ncer la venci\u00f3 y muri\u00f3.<br /><br />Su obra toca temas tales como la marginaci\u00f3n de la mujer, la libertad femenina, al libertad pol\u00edtica en Felipe \u00c1ngeles.

        "biography": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born the third of ten siblings on 22 May 1859 in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father, Charles Altamont Doyle, was born in England of Irish descent, and his mother, born Mary Foley, was Irish. They were married in 1855.<br /><br />Although he is now referred to as \"Conan Doyle\", the origin of this compound surname (if that is how he meant it to be understood) is uncertain. His baptism record in the registry of St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh gives 'Arthur Ignatius Conan' as his Christian name, and simply 'Doyle' as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather.<br /><br />At the age of nine Conan Doyle was sent to the Roman Catholic Jesuit preparatory school, Hodder Place, Stonyhurst. He then went on to Stonyhurst College, leaving in 1875.<br /><br />From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. This required that he provide periodic medical assistance in the towns of Aston (now a district of Birmingham) and Sheffield. While studying, Conan Doyle began writing short stories. His first published story appeared in \"<i>Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</i>\" before he was 20. Following his graduation, he was employed as a ship's doctor on the SS Mayumba during a voyage to the West African coast. He completed his doctorate on the subject of tabes dorsalis in 1885.<br /><br />In 1885 Conan Doyle married Louisa (or Louise) Hawkins, known as \"Touie\". She suffered from tuberculosis and died on 4 July 1906. The following year he married Jean Elizabeth Leckie, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897. Due to his sense of loyalty he had maintained a purely platonic relationship with Jean while his first wife was alive. Jean died in London on 27 June 1940.<br /><br />Conan Doyle fathered five children. Two with his first wife\u2014Mary Louise (28 January 1889 \u2013 12 June 1976), and Arthur Alleyne Kingsley, known as Kingsley (15 November 1892 \u2013 28 October 1918). With his second wife he had three children\u2014Denis Percy Stewart (17 March 1909 \u2013 9 March 1955), second husband in 1936 of Georgian Princess Nina Mdivani (circa 1910 \u2013 19 February 1987; former sister-in-law of Barbara Hutton); Adrian Malcolm (19 November 1910\u20133 June 1970) and Jean Lena Annette (21 December 1912\u201318 November 1997).<br /><br />Conan Doyle was found clutching his chest in the hall of Windlesham, his house in Crowborough, East Sussex, on 7 July 1930. He had died of a heart attack at age 71. His last words were directed toward his wife: \"You are wonderful.\" The epitaph on his gravestone in the churchyard at Minstead in the New Forest, Hampshire, reads:<br /><br />STEEL TRUE<br />BLADE STRAIGHT<br />ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE<br />KNIGHT<br />PATRIOT, PHYSICIAN &amp; MAN OF LETTERS<br /><br />Conan Doyle's house, Undershaw, located in Hindhead, south of London, where he had lived for a decade, had been a hotel and restaurant between 1924 and 2004. It now stands empty while conservationists and Conan Doyle fans fight to preserve it.<br /><br />A statue honours Conan Doyle at Crowborough Cross in Crowborough, where Conan Doyle lived for 23 years. There is also a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, close to the house where Conan Doyle was born.<br /><br /><b>Series:</b><br />* <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/49996-sherlock-holmes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sherlock Holmes</a>",

        "biography": "George Orson Welles, best known as Orson Welles, was an American film director, actor, theatre director, screenwriter, and producer, who worked extensively in film, theatre, television and radio. Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality,<br /><br /> Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early work\u2014despite his notoriously contentious relationship with Hollywood. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, nonlinear narrative forms, innovative uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. <br /><br /> Welles's long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from studios. Many of his films were heavily edited and others left unreleased. He has been praised as a major creative force and as \"the ultimate auteur.\"<br /><br />After directing a number of high-profile theatrical productions in his early twenties, including an innovative adaptation of <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>The Cradle Will Rock</i>, Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel <i>The War of the Worlds</i> performed for the radio drama anthology series Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.<br /><br /><i>Citizen Kane</i> (1941), his first film with RKO, in which he starred in the role of Charles Foster Kane, is often considered the greatest film ever made. Several of his other films, including <i>The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), Chimes at Midnight (1965)</i>, and <i>F for Fake (1974</i>), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.<br /><br />In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives calls him the most acclaimed director of all time. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars list of the greatest American film actors of all time. He was also a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor and an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety shows in the war years.",

He was particularly influential as an editor. Between 1942 and 1947 he acted as reviewer of mostly mystery fiction for the San Francisco Chronicle. In addition to 'Anthony Boucher,' White also employed the pseudonym <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5755979.H_H_Holmes\" rel=\"nofollow\">'H. H. Holmes'</a>, which was the name of a 19th-century serial killer.<br /><br />In a poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, his novel Nine Times Nine was voted as the ninth best locked room mystery of all time.<br /><br />White was born in Oakland, California, and went to college at the University of Southern California. He later received a Masters degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He was admired for his mystery writing but was most noted for his editing, his science fiction anthologies, and his mystery reviews for many years in The New York Times. He was the first English translator of Jorge Luis Borges, translating \"El jard\u00edn de senderos que se bifurcan\" for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. He helped found the Mystery Writers of America in 1946 and, in the same year, was one of the first winners of the MWA's Edgar Award for his mystery reviews in the San Francisco Chronicle. <br /><br />He was founding editor (with J. Francis McComas) of The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction from 1949 to 1958, and was seminal in attempting to make literary quality an important aspect of science fiction. He won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine in 1957 and 1958. Boucher also edited the long-running Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction anthology series, 1952-1959.<br /><br />His short story \"The Quest for Saint Aquin\" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories of all time. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964.<br /><br />Boucher also scripted for radio and was involved in many other activities, as described by William F. Nolan in his essay, \"Who Was Anthony Boucher?\":<br /><br /> The 1940s proved to be a very busy and productive decade for Boucher. In 1945 he launched into a spectacular three-year radio career, plotting more than 100 episodes for The Adventures of Ellery Queen, while also providing plots for the bulk of the Sherlock Holmes radio dramas. By the summer of 1946 he had created his own mystery series for the airwaves, The Casebook of Gregory Hood. (\"I was turning out three scripts each week for as many shows,\" he stated. \"It was a mix of hard work and great fun.\")<br /><br /> Tony left dramatic radio in 1948, \"mainly because I was putting in a lot of hours working with J. Francis McComas in creating what soon became The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. We got it off the ground in 1949 and saw it take hold solidly by 1950. This was a major creative challenge and although I was involved in a lot of other projects, I stayed with F&amp;SF into 1958.\"<br /><br /> Indeed, throughout his years with the magazine, Boucher was certainly involved in \"a lot of other projects.\" Among them:<br /><br /> \u2022 Supplying the SF and crime markets with new fiction.<br /> \u2022 Teaching an informal writing class from his home in Berkeley.<br /> \u2022 Continuing his Sunday mystery columns for the New York Times Book Review.<br /> \u2022 Functioning as chief critic for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.<br /> \u2022 Reviewing SF and fantasy (as H.H. Holmes) for the New York Herald Tribune.<br /> \u2022 Editing True Crime Detective.<br /> \u2022 Supervising the Mercury Mystery Line and (later) the Dell Great Mystery Library.<br /> \u2022 Hosting Golden Voices, his series of historical opera recordings for Pacifica Radio.<br /> \u2022 Serving (in 1951) as president of Mystery Writers of America.<br /><br />In addition to all of this, Tony was a devoted poker player, a political activist, a rabid sport fan (",

        "biography": "Neil deGrasse Tyson was born and raised in New York City where he was educated in the public schools clear through his graduation from the Bronx High School of Science. Tyson went on to earn his BA in Physics from Harvard and his PhD in Astrophysics from Columbia.<br /><br />Tyson's professional research interests are broad, but include star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our Milky Way. Tyson obtains his data from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as from telescopes in California, New Mexico, Arizona, and in the Andes Mountains of Chile.<br /><br />In 2001, Tyson was appointed by President Bush to serve on a 12-member commission that studied the Future of the US Aerospace Industry. The final report was published in 2002 and contained recommendations (for Congress and for the major agencies of the government) that would promote a thriving future of transportation, space exploration, and national security.<br /><br />In 2004, Tyson was once again appointed by President Bush to serve on a 9-member commission on the Implementation of the United States Space Exploration Policy, dubbed the Moon, Mars, and Beyond commission. This group navigated a path by which the new space vision can become a successful part of the American agenda. And in 2006, the head of NASA appointed Tyson to serve on its prestigious Advisory Council, which will help guide NASA through its perennial need to fit its ambitious vision into its restricted budget.<br /><br />In addition to dozens of professional publications, Dr. Tyson has written, and continues to write for the public. He is a monthly essayist for Natural History magazine under the title Universe. And among Tyson's eight books is his memoir The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist; and Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, co-written with Donald Goldsmith. Origins is the companion book to the PBS-NOVA 4-part mini-series Origins, in which Tyson serves as on-camera host. The program premiered on September 28 and 29, 2004. And beginning in the fall of 2006, Tyson appears as the on-camera host of PBS-NOVA's spinoff program NOVA ScienceNow, which is an accessible look at the frontier of all the science that shapes the understanding of our place in the universe.<br /><br />Tyson's latest two books are the playful and informative Death By Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, which was a New York Times bestseller, and The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet, chronicling his experience at the center of the controversy over Pluto's planetary status.<br /><br />Tyson is the recipient of nine honorary doctorates and the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal. His contributions to the public appreciation of the cosmos have been recognized by the International Astronomical Union in their official naming of asteroid 13123 Tyson. On the lighter side, Tyson was voted Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive by People Magazine in 2000.<br /><br />Tyson is the first occupant of the Frederick P. Rose Directorship of the Hayden Planetarium. Tyson lives in New York City with his wife and two children.",

He is an Institute Professor and professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br /><br />Chomsky is credited with the creation of the theory of generative grammar, considered to be one of the most significant contributions to the field of linguistics made in the 20th century. He also helped spark the cognitive revolution in psychology through his review of B. F. Skinner's <i>Verbal Behavior</i>, in which he challenged the behaviorist approach to the study of behavior and language dominant in the 1950s. His naturalistic approach to the study of language has affected the philosophy of language and mind. He is also credited with the establishment of the Chomsky hierarchy, a classification of formal languages in terms of their generative power. Beginning with his critique of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Chomsky has become more widely known for his media criticism and political activism, and for his criticism of the foreign policy of the United States and other governments.<br /><br />According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other living scholar during the 1980\u20131992 time period, and was the eighth-most cited scholar in any time period.<br />",

        "biography": "Taken from Lowry's website:<br />\"I\u2019ve always felt that I was fortunate to have been born the middle child of three. My older sister, Helen, was very much like our mother: gentle, family-oriented, eager to please. Little brother Jon was the only boy and had interests that he shared with Dad; together they were always working on electric trains and erector sets; and later, when Jon was older, they always seemed to have their heads under the raised hood of a car. That left me in-between, and exactly where I wanted most to be: on my own. I was a solitary child who lived in the world of books and my own vivid imagination.<br /><br />Because my father was a career military officer - an Army dentist - I lived all over the world. I was born in Hawaii, moved from there to New York, spent the years of World War II in my mother\u2019s hometown: Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and from there went to Tokyo when I was eleven. High school was back in New York City, but by the time I went to college (Brown University in Rhode Island), my family was living in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />I married young. I had just turned nineteen - just finished my sophomore year in college - when I married a Naval officer and continued the odyssey that military life requires. California. Connecticut (a daughter born there). Florida (a son). South Carolina. Finally Cambridge, Massachusetts, when my husband left the service and entered Harvard Law School (another daughter; another son) and then to Maine - by now with four children under the age of five in tow. My children grew up in Maine. So did I. I returned to college at the University of Southern Maine, got my degree, went to graduate school, and finally began to write professionally, the thing I had dreamed of doing since those childhood years when I had endlessly scribbled stories and poems in notebooks.<br /><br />After my marriage ended in 1977, when I was forty, I settled into the life I have lived ever since. Today I am back in Cambridge, Massachusetts, living and writing in a house dominated by a very shaggy Tibetan Terrier named Bandit. For a change of scenery Martin and I spend time in Maine, where we have an old (it was built in 1768!) farmhouse on top of a hill. In Maine I garden, feed birds, entertain friends, and read...<br /><br />My books have varied in content and style. Yet it seems that all of them deal, essentially, with the same general theme: the importance of human connections. A Summer to Die, my first book, was a highly fictionalized retelling of the early death of my sister, and of the effect of such a loss on a family. Number the Stars, set in a different culture and era, tells the same story: that of the role that we humans play in the lives of our fellow beings.<br /><br />The Giver - and Gathering Blue, and the newest in the trilogy: Messenger - take place against the background of very different cultures and times. Though all three are broader in scope than my earlier books, they nonetheless speak to the same concern: the vital need of people to be aware of their interdependence, not only with each other, but with the world and its environment.<br /><br />My older son was a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. His death in the cockpit of a warplane tore away a piece of my world. But it left me, too, with a wish to honor him by joining the many others trying to find a way to end conflict on this very fragile earth.<br />I am a grandmother now. For my own grandchildren - and for all those of their generation - I try, through writing, to convey my passionate awareness that we live intertwined on this planet and that our future depends upon our caring more, and doing more, for one another.\"",

        "biography": "Date of Birth: 1885<br />Date of Death: 1970<br /><br />Anzia Yezierska, the youngest of nine children, was born into poverty circa 1885 in Russian Poland. Her family immigrated to the Lower East Side of Manhattan around 1892. Immigration officials used the oldest child's name, Mayer, as the last name of the family and switched Anzia's name to Harriet, and so she became Hattie Mayer. After attending elementary school in the United States for only two years, Yezierska started working by selling homemade paper bags, sewing buttons, and rolling cigars. Later she worked in sweatshops and laundries. Yezierska quarreled often with her father, who devoted all of his time to Talmudic study and traditional ideas. Largely due to this, she left home in 1899 and rented a room at the Clara de Hisch Home for Working Girls.<br /><br />Yezierska won a scholarship to Teacher's College, part of Columbia University in 1901. During college, she had to work in a laundry to pay for expenses not covered in the scholarship. She had little interest in domestic studies, for which her scholarship was granted, and she felt inferior to the American students at the school. She graduated in 1905 as a cooking teacher, but she did not remain a teacher for long because she disliked it intensely.<br /><br />Yezierska married Jacob Gordon, but she left him the day after the ceremony. The marriage was annulled after six months, because she had refused to consummate it. Later that year she married Arnold Levitas, but the two quarreled often over money and housework. Levitas wanted Yezierska to play the role of the traditional wife, but Yezierska rejected being inferior to her husband. She became pregnant in 1912 and went to live with her sister on the West Coast, where she came to think of herself as a spokesperson for Jewish immigrants. Although she took a job as a social worker for Hebrew Charities in San Francisco, Yezierska was unable to support her daughter as a single mother and was forced to send her to live with her father.<br /><br />She did not begin creative writing until 1913, when she was about 28, but she published her first story two years later in Forum Magazine. Yezierska returned to the east in 1917 but could only find part-time teaching jobs. <br /><br />Fearing that she was a victim of class prejudice, she went to John Dewey, the dean of Teacher's College, for help. He encouraged her to write, allowing her to attend his graduate seminar and hiring her as a translator for a project. There was romantic interest between the two, which he ended by taking a three year lecture tour in the Far East. Characters like Dewey appear in many pieces of Yezierska's writing.<br /><br />Yezierska's story, \"The Fat of the Land,\" was called the best story of 1919 by Edward O'Brien. Hollywood offered $10,000 for the movie rights to the film, and Yezierska went to California, but she refused to sign the three year contract. A fellowship at the University of Wisconsin in 1929 allowed her to continue writing. Returning to New York, Yezierska became impoverished once again during the depression, and so she was able to join the New York Work Projects Administration Writers Project. In addition to short stories and novels, Yezierska wrote book reviews for the New York Times. She wrote her autobiography in 1950 and died forgotten in 1970.",

        "biography": "Dr. David Jeremiah, founder of Turning Point Radio and Television Ministries and senior pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church, felt God\u2019s calling on his life at a very early age. Born February 13, 1941 in Toledo, Ohio, Dr. Jeremiah was raised in a family deeply committed to ministry. At the age of eleven, Dr. Jeremiah and his family moved to Dayton, Ohio where his father, Dr. James T. Jeremiah, was the Pastor of Emmanuel Baptist Church, and in 1953 became the President of Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio.<br /><br /><br />As Dr. Jeremiah was sensitive to God\u2019s leading in his life, he followed in his father\u2019s footsteps. In 1963, Dr. Jeremiah received a Bachelor of Arts from Cedarville College. In that same year, Dr. Jeremiah married his college sweetheart, Donna Thompson who also was attending Cedarville College as a business major. He went on to earn a Masters degree in Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1967. He completed additional graduate work at Grace University and was granted the Doctor of Divinity degree from Cedarville College in 1981.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 1969, Dr. Jeremiah began Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and developed a Christian school grades K through 12. In the 12 years he served as pastor, Blackhawk Baptist Church grew from 7 families to 1300 members. He also launched The Bible Hour television program.<br /><br /><br /><br />Dr. Jeremiah heeded God\u2019s call, and in 1981 he and his family moved to California where he became the senior pastor of Scott Memorial Baptist Church, now Shadow Mountain Community Church.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shadow Mountain Community Church is one of the largest churches in San Diego County. It is also the home of Southern California Seminary and Christian Unified Schools. <br /><br /><br /><br />As Dr. Jeremiah began his ministry at Shadow Mountain, he felt God\u2019s calling to continue the broadcast ministry he started in Fort Wayne. In 1982, Turning Point Ministries became a reality.<br /><br /><br /><br />Today, Turning Point's 30-minute radio program is heard nationally and internationally on over 1800 stations and translator/satellators. In recognition of Dr. Jeremiah\u2019s commitment to teaching the Word of God, he received the Broadcaster of the Year Award in 1999 from the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), in August 2002, received the Award of Merit from the Western Chapter of National Religious Broadcasters for Excellence in Broadcasting and Faithfulness in Service, and in 2006 Turning Point received the Best Radio Teaching Program Award. Dr. Jeremiah has served on the Board of Directors for the NRB since 1996.<br /><br /><br /><br />Turning Point launched a television program in 1982 in San Diego and went nationwide in 2000. Now seen around the world through cable and satellite technology, as well as on terrestrial stations all across the United States, conservative estimates suggest that close to 200 million homes around the world have access to Dr. Jeremiah's Bible teaching each week. Turning Point Television offers a half-hour Bible study message and a full hour worship service with the same great preaching. Carried on several national and international networks such as TBN, ION, and INSP, Turning Point Television has most recently been added to Middle East TV Network and BET, the Black Entertainment Network.<br /><br /><br /><br />Dr. Jeremiah is a sought-after conference speaker for organizations around the country. He frequently speaks at Cedarville College, Dallas Theological Seminary, Moody Bible Institute, Billy Graham Training Center, Phil Waldrep\u2019s Senior Adult Celebrations and numerous NFL, NBA and Baseball chapels.<br /><br /><br /><br />Along with his speaking schedule around the country, Dr. Jeremiah also finds time to fulfill another passion in his life, writing. His books are always gripping and right to the point. Some of his books include Escape the Coming Night, The Power of Encouragement, What the Bible Says About Angels, Prayer The Great Adventure, which brought him The Gold Medallion Award in 1998, God In You, Gifts from God",

It's not exactly like I'm going to say \"I was born in Alabama\u2026\" and somebody's going to jump up and snarl, \"Oh yeah? Prove it!\" At least I hope not.<br /><br />I think what gets me feeling itchy is all that emphasis on the facts of a life, while all the juicy, relevant, human oddity stuff gets left on the cutting room floor. I could tell you the facts\u2013I lived in Texas for most of my life; I live in New York City with my husband and six-year-old son now; I have freckles and a lopsided smile; I'm allergic to penicillin.<br /><br />But that doesn't really give you much insight into me. That doesn't tell you that I stuck a bead up my nose while watching TV when I was four and thought I'd have to go to the ER and have it cut out. Or that I once sang a punk version of \"Que Sera Sera\" onstage in New York City. Or that I made everyone call me \"Bert\" in ninth grade for no reason that I can think of. See what I mean?<br /><br />God is in the details. So with that in mind, here is my bio. Sort of.<br /><br /><br />TEN THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME by Libba Bray<br /><br />1. I lived in Texas until I was 26 years old, then I moved to New York City with $600.00 in my shoe ('cause muggers won't take it out of your shoe, y'know . . . riiiiight . . .) and a punchbowl (my grandmother's gift) under my arm. I ended up using the punchbowl box as an end table for two years.<br /><br />2. My dad was a Presbyterian minister. Yes, I am one of those dreaded P.K.s\u2013Preacher's Kids. Be afraid. Be very afraid . . .<br /><br />3. The first story I ever wrote, in Mrs. McBee's 6th grade English class, was about a girl whose family is kidnapped and held hostage by a murderous lot of bank robbers who intend to kill the whole family\u2013including the dog\u2013until the 12-year-old heroine foils the plot and saves the day. It included colored pencil illustrations of manly-looking, bearded criminals smoking, and, oblivious to the fact that The Beatles had already sort of laid claim to the title, I called my novel, HELP. My mom still has a copy. And when I do something she doesn't like, she threatens to find it.<br /><br />4. My favorite word is \"redemption.\" I like both its meaning and the sound. My least favorite word is \"maybe.\" \"Maybe\" is almost always a \"no\" drawn out in cruel fashion.<br /><br />5. My three worst habits are overeating, self-doubt, and the frequent use of the \"f\" word.<br /><br />6. The three things I like best about myself are my sense of humor, my ability to listen, and my imagination.<br /><br />7. I have an artificial left eye. I lost my real eye in a car accident when I was eighteen. In fact, I had to have my entire face rebuilt because I smashed it up pretty good. It took six years and thirteen surgeries. However, I did have the pleasure of freezing a plastic eyeball in an ice cube, putting it in a friend's drink, (\"Eyeball in your highball?\") and watching him freak completely. Okay, so maybe that's not going down on my good karma record. But it sure was fun.<br /><br />8. In 7th grade, my three best friends and I dressed up as KISS and walked around our neighborhood on Halloween. Man, we were such dorks.<br /><br />9. I once spent New Year's Eve in a wetsuit. I'd gone to the party in a black dress that was a little too tight (too many holiday cookies) and when I went to sit down, the dress ripped up the back completely. Can we all say, mortified? The problem was, my friends were moving out of their house\u2013everything was packed and on a truck\u2013and there was nothing I could put on . . . but a wetsuit that they still had tacked to the wall. I spent the rest of the party maneuvering through throngs of people feeling like a giant squid.<br /><br />10. I got married in Florence, Italy. My husband and I were in love but totally broke, so we eloped and got married in Italy, where he was going on a business trip. We had to pull a guy off the street to be our witness. It was incredibly romantic.",

As he says: \"Almost everybody I know has this sense of overdosing on information and getting dizzy living at post-human speeds. Nearly everybody I know does something to try to remove herself to clear her head and to have enough time and space to think. ... All of us instinctively feel that something inside us is crying out for more spaciousness and stillness to offset the exhilarations of this movement and the fun and diversion of the modern world.\"",

        "biography": "Christopher Eric Hitchens was an English-born American author, journalist and literary critic. He was a contributor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>World Affairs</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Free Inquiry</i> and a variety of other media outlets. Hitchens was also a political observer, whose best-selling books \u2014 the most famous being <i>God Is Not Great</i> \u2014 made him a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits. He was also a media fellow at the Hoover Institution.<br /><br />Hitchens was a polemicist and intellectual. While he was once identified with the Anglo-American radical political left, near the end of his life he embraced some arguably right-wing causes, most notably the Iraq War. Formerly a Trotskyist and a fixture in the left wing publications of both the United Kingdom and United States, Hitchens departed from the grassroots of the political left in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the European left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie, but he stated on the Charlie Rose show aired August 2007 that he remained a \"Democratic Socialist.\"<br /><br />The September 11, 2001 attacks strengthened his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" He is known for his ardent admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson, and for his excoriating critiques of Mother Teresa, Henry Kissinger and Bill Clinton.<br /><br />Hitchens was an anti-theist, and he described himself as a believer in the Enlightenment values of secularism, humanism, and reason.<br /> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christop...</a>",

        "biography": "Terence James Stannus Gray, better known by the pen name Wei Wu Wei, was a 20th-century Taoist philosopher and writer. Terence James Stannus Gray was born in Felixstowe, Suffolk, England on 14 September 1895, the son of Harold Stannus Gray and a member of a well-established Irish family. He was raised on an estate at the Gog-Magog Hills outside Cambridge, England. He received a thorough education at Ascham St Vincent's School, Eastbourne, Eton and Oxford University. Early in life he pursued an interest in Egyptology which culminated in the publication of two books on ancient Egyptian history and culture in 1923. This was followed by a period of involvement in the arts in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s as a theorist, theatrical producer, creator of radical \"dance-dramas\", publisher of several related magazines and author of two related books. He was a major influence on many noted dramatists, poets and dancers of the day, including his cousin Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet (which in fact had its origins in his own dance troupe at the Cambridge Festival Theatre which he leased from 1926 to 1933).<br /><br />He maintained his family's racehorses in England and Ireland and in 1957 his horse Zarathrustra won the Ascot Gold Cup, ridden by renowned jockey Lester Piggott in the first of his eleven wins of that race.<br /><br />After he had apparently exhausted his interest in the theatre, his thoughts turned towards philosophy and metaphysics. This led to a period of travel throughout Asia, including time spent at Sri Ramana Maharshi's ashram in Tiruvannamalai, India. In 1958, at the age of 63, he saw the first of the \"Wei Wu Wei\" titles published. The next 16 years saw the appearance of seven subsequent books, including his final work under the further pseudonym \"O.O.O.\" in 1974. During most of this later period he maintained a residence with his wife Natalia Bagration-Imeretinsky in Monaco. He is believed to have known, among others, Lama Anagarika Govinda, Dr. Hubert Benoit, John Blofeld, Douglas Harding, Robert Linssen, Arthur Osborne, Robert Powell and Dr. D. T. Suzuki. He died in 1986 at the age of 90.<br /><br />Wei Wu Wei's influence, while never widespread, has been profound upon many of those who knew him personally, upon those with whom he corresponded, among them British mathematician and author G. Spencer-Brown and Galen Sharp, as well as upon many who have read his works, including Ramesh Balsekar.<br /><br />It is apparent from his writings that \"Wei Wu Wei\" had studied in some depth both Eastern and Western philosophy and metaphysics, as well as the more esoteric teachings of all the great religions. It can also be understood from the writings that he regarded himself as merely one of many seeking so-called \"liberation\", the works themselves being seen in part as a record of this quest.",

The adaptation of <i>Fight Club</i> was a flop at the box office, but achieved cult status on DVD. The film\u2019s popularity drove sales of the novel. Chuck put out two novels in 1999, <i>Survivor</i> and <i>Invisible Monsters</i>. <i>Choke</i>, published in 2001, became Chuck\u2019s first New York Times bestseller. Chuck\u2019s work has always been infused with personal experience, and his next novel, <i>Lullaby</i>, was no exception. Chuck credits writing <i>Lullaby</i> with helping him cope with the tragic death of his father. <i>Diary</i> and the non-fiction guide to Portland, <i>Fugitives and Refugees</i>, were released in 2003. While on the road in support of <i>Diary</i>, Chuck began reading a short story entitled 'Guts,' which would eventually become part of the novel <i>Haunted</i>.<br /><br />In the years that followed, he continued to write, publishing the bestselling <i>Rant, Snuff, Pygmy, Tell-All, a 'remix' of Invisible Monsters, Damned</i>, and most recently, <i>Doomed</i>. <br /><br />Chuck also enjoys giving back to his fans, and teaching the art of storytelling has been an important part of that. In 2004, Chuck began submitting essays to ChuckPalahniuk.net on the craft of writing. These were 'How To' pieces, straight out of Chuck's personal bag of tricks, based on the tenants of minimalism he learned from Tom Spanbauer. Every month, a \u201cHomework Assignment\u201d would accompany the lesson, so Workshop members could apply what they had learned. (all 36 of these essays can currently be found on The Cult's sister-site, LitReactor.com).<br /><br />Then, in 2009, Chuck increased his involvement by committing to read and review a selection of fan-written stories each month. The best stories are currently set to be published in <i>Burnt Tongues</i>, a forthcoming anthology, with an introduction written by Chuck himself. <br /><br />His next novel, <i>Beautiful You</i>, is due out in October 2014.<br />",

He won the Pulitzer in 1947 for his novel All the King's Men (1946) and won his subsequent Pulitzer Prizes for poetry in 1957 and then in 1979.<br /><br />Warren was born on April 24, 1905, in Guthrie, Kentucky. He graduated from Clarksville High School in Tennessee, Vanderbilt University in 1925 and the University of California, Berkeley in 1926. Warren later attended Yale University and obtained his B. Litt. as a Rhodes Scholar from New College, Oxford, in England in 1930. That same year he began his teaching career at Southwestern College (now called Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee.

        "biography": "Born in Memphis, Tennessee. She attended Miss Hutchison's School and three different universities, without obtaining a degree. According to her obituary in the New York Times, Fitzhugh graduated from Barnard College in 1950. She lived most of her adult life in New York City and had houses in both Long Island and Bridgewater, Connecticut.<br /><br />She was married briefly to Ed Thompson, whom she dated in high school. After high school, she primarily dated women.<br /><br />Fitzhugh was the illustrator of the 1961 children's book Suzuki Beane, a parody of Eloise; while Eloise lived in the Plaza, Suzuki was the daughter of beatnik parents and slept on a mattress on the floor of a Bleecker Street pad in Greenwich Village. Fitzhugh worked closely with author Sandra Scoppettone to produce Suzuki Beane, which incorporated typewriter font and line drawings in an original way. Although a parody of both Eloise and beatnik conceit, the book sprang to life as a genuine work of literature. Today, it is a much sought-after book on used-book websites.<br /><br />Fitzhugh's best-known book was Harriet the Spy, published in 1964 to some controversy since so many characters were far from admirable. It has since become a classic. As her New York Times' obituary, published November 19, 1974, states: \"The book helped introduce a new realism to children's fiction and has been widely imitated\". Harriet is the daughter of affluent New Yorkers who leave her in the care of her nanny, Ole Golly, in their Manhattan townhouse. Hardly the feminine girl heroine typical of the early 1960s, Harriet is a writer who notes everything about everybody in her world in a notebook which ultimately falls into the wrong hands. Ole Golly gives Harriet the unlikely but practical advice that: \"Sometimes you have to lie. But to yourself you must always tell the truth\". By and large, Harriet the Spy was well-received -- it was awarded a New York Times Outstanding Book Award in 1964 -- and has sold 4 million copies since publication. Two characters from the book, Beth Ellen and Sport, were featured in two of Fitzhugh's later books, The Long Secret and Sport. The Long Secret deals fairly honestly with female puberty; the main characters are pre-teen girls who discuss how their changing bodies feel.<br /><br />Fitzhugh illustrated many of her books and had works exhibited in Banfer Gallery, New York, in 1963, among many other galleries.<br /><br />She died in 1974 of a brain aneurysm. Her obituary was published in the New York Times.",

        "biography": "Mary Noel Streatfeild, known as Noel Streatfeild, was an author best known and loved for her children's books, including <i>Ballet Shoes</i> and <i>Circus Shoes</i>. She was born on Christmas Eve, 1895, the daughter of William Champion Streatfeild and Janet Venn and the second of six children to be born to the couple. Sister Ruth was the oldest, after Noel came Barbara, William ('Bill'), Joyce (who died of TB prior to her second birthday) and Richenda. Ruth and Noel attended Hastings and St. Leonard's Ladies' College in 1910. As an adult, she began theater work, and spent approximately 10 years in the theater. <br /><br />During the Great War, in 1915 Noel worked first as a volunteer in a soldier's hospital kitchen near Eastbourne Vicarage and later produced two plays with her sister Ruth. When things took a turn for the worse on the Front in 1916 she moved to London and obtained a job making munitions in Woolwich Arsenal. At the end of the war in January 1919, Noel enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Art (later Royal Academy) in London. <br /><br />In 1930, she began writing her first adult novel, <i>The Whicharts</i>, published in 1931. In June 1932, she was elected to membership of PEN. Early in 1936, Mabel Carey, children's editor of J. M. Dent and Sons, asks Noel to write a children's story about the theatre, which led to Noel completing <i>Ballet Shoes</i> in mid-1936. In 28 September 1936, when <i>Ballet Shoes</i> was published, it became an immediate best seller.<br /><br />According to Angela Bull, <i>Ballet Shoes</i> was a reworked version of <i>The Whicharts</i>. Elder sister Ruth Gervis illustrated the book, which was published on the 28th September, 1936. At the time, the plot and general 'attitude' of the book was highly original, and destined to provide an outline for countless other ballet books down the years until this day. The first known book to be set at a stage school, the first ballet story to be set in London, the first to feature upper middle class society, the first to show the limits of amateurism and possibly the first to show children as self-reliant, able to survive without running to grownups when things went wrong.<br /><br />In 1937, Noel traveled with Bertram Mills Circus to research <i>The Circus is Coming</i> (also known as <i>Circus Shoes</i>). She won the Carnegie gold medal in February 1939 for this book. In 1940, World War II began, and Noel began war-related work from 1940-1945. During this time, she wrote four adult novels, five children's books, nine romances, and innumerable articles and short stories. On May 10th, 1941, her flat was destroyed by a bomb. Shortly after WWII is over, in 1947, Noel traveled to America to research film studios for her book <i>The Painted Garden</i>. In 1949, she began delivering lectures on children's books. Between 1949 and 1953, her plays, The Bell Family radio serials played on the Children's Hour and were frequently voted top play of the year. <br /><br />Early in 1960s, she decided to stop writing adult novels, but did write some autobiographical novels, such as <i>A Vicarage Family</i> in 1963. She also had written 12 romance novels under the pen name \"Susan Scarlett.\" Her children's books number at least 58 titles. From July to December 1979, she suffered a series of small strokes and moved into a nursing home. In 1983, she received the honor Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). On 11 September 1986, she passed away in a nursing home.",

        "biography": "Pauline Diana Baynes was an English book illustrator, whose work encompassed more than 100 books, notably those by C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Pauline is probably best known for her illustrations in <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> by C.S. Lewis. She was also J.R.R. Tolkien's chosen illustrator: her drawings appear in <i>Farmer Giles of Ham</i>, <i>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</i>, <i>Smith of Wootton Major</i>, <i>Tree and Leaf</i>, and after Tolkien's death the poem <i>Bilbo's Last Song</i>.<br /><br />Pauline Baynes began her career with little formal training. After spending her early years in India, where her father was commissioner in Agra, she and her elder sister came to England for their schooling. When their father retired, their parents settled near Farnham in Surrey and Pauline, as the unmarried daughter, found herself looking after them during the day and trying to illustrate at night.<br /><br />Pauline attended the Slade School of Fine Art, where her sister was completing a diploma course, but after only a year she volunteered to work for the Ministry of Defence, painting camouflage. However, since her kind of attention to detail and accuracy were skills essential for map-making, she was soon transferred to another department to draw maps. This experience was very helpful when she later drew maps of Narnia for Jack, and of Middle-earth for his friend J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />Over the years Pauline Baynes created many new illustrations for use on book jackets, as well as colouring the original illustrations. In 1989, she made a series of full-page colour paintings for two books, one called <i>The Land of Narnia</i>, and the other a beautiful, deluxe version of <i>The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe</i>. <br /><br />She was awarded the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal in 1968 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to children's illustration.",

        "biography": "P. D. James, byname of Phyllis Dorothy James White, Baroness James of Holland Park, (born August 3, 1920, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England\u2014died November 27, 2014, Oxford), British mystery novelist best known for her fictional detective Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard.<br /><br />The daughter of a middle-grade civil servant, James grew up in the university town of Cambridge. Her formal education, however, ended at age 16 because of lack of funds, and she was thereafter self-educated. In 1941 she married Ernest C.B. White, a medical student and future physician, who returned home from wartime service mentally deranged and spent much of the rest of his life in psychiatric hospitals. To support her family (which included two children), she took work in hospital administration and, after her husband\u2019s death in 1964, became a civil servant in the criminal section of the Department of Home Affairs. Her first mystery novel, Cover Her Face (1962), introduced Dalgliesh and was followed by six more mysteries before she retired from government service in 1979 to devote full time to writing.<br /><br />Dalgliesh, James\u2019s master detective who rises from chief inspector in the first novel to chief superintendent and then to commander, is a serious, introspective person, moralistic yet realistic. The novels in which he appears are peopled by fully rounded characters, who are civilized, genteel, and motivated. The public resonance created by James\u2019s singular characterization and deployment of classic mystery devices led to most of the novels featuring Dalgliesh being filmed for television. James, who earned the sobriquet \u201cQueen of Crime,\u201d penned 14 Dalgliesh novels, with the last, The Private Patient, appearing in 2008.<br /><br />James also wrote An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1972) and The Skull Beneath the Skin (1982), which centre on Cordelia Gray, a young private detective. The first of these novels was the basis for both a television movie and a short-lived series. James expanded beyond the mystery genre in The Children of Men (1992; film 2006), which explores a dystopian world in which the human race has become infertile. Her final work, Death Comes to Pemberley (2011)\u2014a sequel to Pride and Prejudice (1813)\u2014amplifies the class and relationship tensions between Jane Austen\u2019s characters by situating them in the midst of a murder investigation. James\u2019s nonfiction works include The Maul and the Pear Tree (1971), a telling of the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811 written with historian T.A. Critchley, and the insightful Talking About Detective Fiction (2009). Her memoir, Time to Be in Earnest, was published in 2000. She was made OBE in 1983 and was named a life peer in 1991.",

        "biography": "Talk about misspent youth. What did I do during those lazy summer days of childhood when I could\u2019ve been honing my writing skills? Nothing. Okay, so I spent a lot of time dreaming I was a cowgirl with a trusty black stallion. Oh, and I read every Walter Farley horse novel. I was an only child so I relied on my imagination to supply the excitement in my life.<br /><br />By high school, I\u2019d decided to trade in my lariat for a trench coat. I was into dark and dangerous. As an intrepid foreign correspondent, I\u2019d stalk the mean streets of the world. Did I actually write anything? No, but I did read all of Agatha Christie\u2019s mysteries.<br /><br />I worked at a department store during college. My short stint in the accounting department taught me a lot about math. Three hundred-dollar shortages plus hysterical tears equaled instant move to gift-wrap. A career in math was not in my future. I didn\u2019t care because I\u2019d discovered \u201creal\u201d literature. I plowed through James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses and Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace. If it didn\u2019t make my eyes cross then it wasn\u2019t worth reading. Yes, I admit it, I was a literary snob.<br /><br />Nina and best buddy, Barbara Joyce.<br />Folk singers extraordinaire.<br /><br />But there\u2019s just so much \u201creal\u201d literature one person can take. I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in English Literature and a determination to avoid books that induced eye crossing or had tragic endings. The only things I managed to write during those years were research papers.<br /><br />I taught second grade for several years then spent two years in Dublin, Ireland. A friend and I supported ourselves by singing folk songs in Irish pubs. We weren\u2019t great, but we were young, enthusiastic, and wore short skirts. It was obviously my destiny to be the next Judy Collins. I spent a lot of time poring through music books.<br /><br />Returning to New Jersey and reality, I taught elementary school until I grew restless again. My cross-country odyssey included stays in Arizona, California, and Texas. Along the way, I indulged my love of horses. No black stallions, but I did have several beautiful Arabian mares. I read tons of books on breeding and showing.<br /><br />Somewhere between California and Texas I grew addicted to romance novels and cats. The cat\u2019s independent attitude was exactly the quality I admired in my romance heroes. And once I decided to try writing my own romances, I made sure a cat crept into each story.<br /><br />Texas is my permanent home. I\u2019ve come full circle. Born in San Antonio, I spent most of my life in New Jersey. Maybe the Texas in my blood accounts for my attachment to strong men, fast horses, and wide-open spaces. My love of cats? Haven\u2019t a clue.",

        "biography": "Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was a Spanish novelist, poet, and playwright. His novel <i>Don Quixote</i> is often considered his magnum opus, as well as the first modern novel.<br />It is assumed that Miguel de Cervantes was born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. His father was Rodrigo de Cervantes, a surgeon of cordoban descent. Little is known of his mother Leonor de Cortinas, except that she was a native of Arganda del Rey.<br />In 1569, Cervantes moved to Italy, where he served as a valet to Giulio Acquaviva, a wealthy priest who was elevated to cardinal the next year. By then, Cervantes had enlisted as a soldier in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment and continued his military life until 1575, when he was captured by Algerian corsairs. He was then released on ransom from his captors by his parents and the Trinitarians, a Catholic religious order. He subsequently returned to his family in Madrid.<br />In Esquivias (Province of Toledo), on 12 December 1584, he married the much younger Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (Toledo, Esquivias \u2013, 31 October 1626), daughter of Fernando de Salazar y Vozmediano and Catalina de Palacios. Her uncle Alonso de Quesada y Salazar is said to have inspired the character of Don Quixote. During the next 20 years Cervantes led a nomadic existence, working as a purchasing agent for the Spanish Armada and as a tax collector. He suffered a bankruptcy and was imprisoned at least twice (1597 and 1602) for irregularities in his accounts. Between 1596 and 1600, he lived primarily in Seville. In 1606, Cervantes settled in Madrid, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br />Cervantes died in Madrid on April 23, 1616.<br /><i>-Copied from Wikipedia</i>",

        "biography": "<i>Eric A. Kimmel</i> was born in Brooklyn, NY in 1946. He attended PS 193, Andries Hudde Junior High School, and Midwood High School. Brooklyn College was across the street from his high school, so he didn\u2019t want to go there. He headed west, to Easton, Pennsylvania where he graduated from Lafayette College in 1967 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature. <br />Eric worked as an elementary school teacher at P.S. 68 in Manhattan while working on his masters degree at New York University. From there he went to the US. Virgin Islands where he worked as a teacher and librarian. He spent a lot of time lying on St. Thomas\u2019 beautiful beaches. <br />Returning to reality, he finished his Ph.D. degree in Education at the University of Illinois in 1973. He taught courses in language arts, children\u2019s literature, and storytelling at Indiana University at South Bend in South Bend, Indiana from 1973 to 1978, and from 1978 to 1993 at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. Eric retired from college teaching in 1993 to become a full-time writer. He still holds the rank of Professor Emeritus of Education at Portland State. <br />Eric has wanted to be an author since he first discovered back in kindergarten that people called authors make books. His first book came out in 1974. Since then he has published over fifty titles, many of which have won numerous state awards, appeared on school and library recommended lists, and won prestigious awards such as the Caldecott Honor Medal (<i>Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins</i>) and the Sydney Taylor Picture Book Award (<i>The Chanukkah Guest</i> and <i>Gershon\u2019s Monster</i>). <br />Eric travels throughout the United States and the world visiting schools, talking about his books, and telling stories. His first love is sharing stories from different countries and cultures. During the last several years he and his wife Doris have visited China, Norway, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Singapore, Canada, and Panama. He is always looking out for ideas for new books. <br />Eric and Doris live in Portland, Oregon. Eric has a dog named Tasha, a cat named Inky, and a tank full of tropical fish. He has several hobbies. He loves bluegrass music. He keeps his banjo next to his desk so he can practice whenever he takes a break from writing.",

His work is characterized by a rather na\u00efve but highly spirited love of the grotesque and represents a commercialization of the Romantic taste for the bizarre. Drawings of London done in 1869-71 were more sober studies of the poorer quarters of the city and captured the attention of van Gogh. In the 1870s he also took up painting (doing some large and ambitions religious works) and sculpture (the monument to the dramatist and novelist Alexandre Dumas in the Place Malesherbes in Paris, erected in 1883, is his work).",

        "biography": "Fern Michaels isn\u2019t a person. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s an entity either since an entity is something with separate existence. Fern Michaels\u00ae is what I DO. Me, Mary Ruth Kuczkir. Growing up in Hastings, Pennsylvania, I was called Ruth. I became Mary when I entered the business world where first names were the order of the day. To this day, family and friends call me Dink, a name my father gave me when I was born because according to him I was \u2018a dinky little thing\u2019 weighing in at four and a half pounds. However, I answer to Fern since people are more comfortable with a name they can pronounce.<br /><br />As they say, the past is prologue. I grew up, got a job, got married, had five kids. When my youngest went off to Kindergarten, my husband told me to get off my ass and get a job. Those were his exact words. I didn\u2019t know how to do anything except be a wife and mother. I was also a voracious reader having cut my teeth on The Bobbsey Twins, Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, Cherry Ames and the like. The library was a magical place for me. It still is to this day. Rather than face the outside world with no skills, I decided to write a book. For some reason that didn\u2019t intimidate me. As my husband said at the time, stupid is as stupid does. Guess what, I don\u2019t have that husband any more. Guess what else! I wrote 99 books, most of them New York Times Best Sellers.<br /><br />Moving right along here . . . Several years ago I left Ballantine Books, parted company with my agent, sold my house in New Jersey that I had lived in all my married life and in 1993 moved to South Carolina. I figured if I was going to go through trauma let it be all at one time. It was a breeze. The kids were all on their own at that point. The dump was a 300 year old plantation house that is listed in the National Registry that I remodeled. Today it is beyond belief as are the gardens and the equally old Angel Oaks that drip Spanish moss. Unfortunately, I could not get my ghost to relocate. This ghost has been documented by previous owners. Mary Margaret as we call her, is \u201ca friendly\u201d. She is also mischievous. It took me two weeks to figure out that she didn\u2019t like my coffee cups. They would slide off the table or counter or else they\u2019d break in the dishwasher. I bought red checkered ones. All are intact as of this writing. She moves pillows from one room to the other and she stops all the clocks in the house at 9:10 in the a.m. at least once a week. When the Azaleas are in bloom, and only then, I find blooms on my night stand. I have this glorious front porch and during the warm months I see my swing moving early in the morning when the air is still and again late in the day. She doesn\u2019t spook the dogs. I always know when she\u2019s around because the five of them line up and look like they\u2019re at a tennis match. As of this writing we\u2019re co-habiting nicely.<br /><br />Most writers love what they do and I\u2019m no exception. I love it when I get a germ of an idea and get it down on paper. I love breathing life into my characters. I love writing about women who persevere and prevail because that\u2019s what I had to do to get to this point in time. It\u2019s another way of saying it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019ve been, what matters is where you\u2019re going and how you get there. The day I finally prevailed was the day I was inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame. For me it was an awesome day and there are no words to describe it.<br />I\u2019ve been telling stories and scribbling for 37 years. I hope I can continue for another 37 years. It wasn\u2019t easy during some of those years. As I said, I had to persevere. My old Polish grandmother said something to me when I was little that I never forgot. She said when God is good to you, you have to give back. For a while I didn\u2019t know how to do that. When I finally figured it out I set up The Fern Michaels\u00ae Foundation. <br /><br />READ FERN MICHAELS' FULL BIOGRAPHY HERE: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fernmichaels.com/biography/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fernmichaels.com/biography/</a>",

She dreams in bright, vivid images of the characters intent on taking over her writing life, and fights a constant battle to put them on the hard drive of her computer before they can disappear as fast as they appeared. Lora\u2019s family, and her writing life co-exist, if not in harmony, in relative peace with each other. Surrounded by a menagerie of pets, friends, and a teenage son who keeps her quick wit engaged, Lora\u2019s life is filled with joys, aided by her fans whose hearts remind her daily why she writes.<br /><br /><i>Librarian Note: There is more than one author in the GoodReads database with this name.</i><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67877005-lora-leigh%C2%A0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6...</a><br /><br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/author/loraleigh\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us.macmillan.com/author/loraleigh</a>",

        "biography": "<i>Also writes under the pen name <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7801320.Laurie_Fitzgerald\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laurie Fitzgerald</a>.</i><br /><br />Lorie O'Clare was born in 1965 in San Diego, CA. She's the oldest of three children and for the first part of her life traveled with her family, living in many Midwestern states, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana and finally Kansas. She graduated from high school in 1983 as a junior and began her college life at age 17. She received a double major in English and Political Science in 1991. Although her original intentions were to go on to law school, and she went as far as taking the LSAT, being a lawyer wasn't in the writing for Ms. O'Clare.<br /><br />The same year she graduated from the Univ. of KS. she also married. Ten months later she gave birth to her first son. Her second son was born in 1994 and her third son in 1996. Although she wanted a daughter, this was also a plan of hers that would never happen. Six months after her third son was born she had a hysterectomy.<br /><br />Her marriage lasted ten years with an amiable parting. During those years, Lorie began reading every romance she could get her hands on. Times were hard and she went through every romance novel her library had, then found very cheap book clubs and received new romance novels in the mail each month. The Internet also entered Lorie's life during this time and she made on line friends with similar interests to hers.<br /><br />Lorie continued with her passion for reading, merging into other genres when she was convinced she'd read every published romance novel out there. While reading she often experienced the sensation that she could have made the story better. She began writing, purely for her own satisfaction. In those early years, when her boys were young and she was newly divorced, Lorie wrote eight full length novels. All but one of those novels would later be published.<br /><br />In 1998, Lorie took the push from her on line friends and tried publishing her first novel, a children's story called Dolls Of Tashan. She printed manuscripts on her word processor and mailed them out as often as she could afford the postage. The rejection letters were painful but she kept every one of them, first in one spiral notebook, then eventually adding another, and finally a third. In 2003, Lorie published her first book with a very small epublisher called Amber Quill Press. The book wasn't her children's story but a romance novel. To this day she has not published Dolls of Tashan, the first book she ever wrote.<br /><br />Later that same year, a good friend encouraged Lorie to try writing erotic romance. Lorie had a completed novel ready to submit. Instead of sending it to her current epublisher, she submitted it to a larger epublisher called Ellora's Cave. Although this was an erotic romance publisher and Lorie's novel was a simple romance, with little more than a chaste kiss, Ellora's Cave contracted the book and assigned an editor who taught Lorie how to write erotic romance. The book contracted was In Her Blood, a werewolf novel. Her new editor suggested she write a short story and turn the werewolves into a series. Lorie did this and her first book published with Ellora's Cave was Pack Law in October, 2003.<br /><br />Today Lorie O'Clare has published over 60 books. She still writes for Ellora's Cave. In 2008 she sold her first book to St. Martins, which took her name into mass market publishing. Today Lorie has two books out with St. Martins with six more scheduled to release over the next couple of years. She also sold a book to Kensington Press in 2008. Currently she has two books out with Kensington and plans to continue writing for them as well.<br /><br />Lorie writes full time, lives with her teenage boys, her two dogs, Dude, her Boston Terrier, and Lady, her Beagle. She also has two American Short hair cats, Ernie and Tigger. She plans on writing until she dies. \"There is nothing more fulfilling than creating a new world and walking through it with the people who live there,",

This book explores the historical development of the telegraph and the social ramifications associated with this development. Tom Standage also proposes that if Victorians from the 1800s were to be around today, they would be far from impressed with present Internet capabilities. This is because the development of the telegraph essentially mirrored the development of the Internet. Both technologies can be seen to have largely impacted the speed and transmission of information and both were widely criticised by some, due to their perceived negative consequences.<br /><br />Standage has taken part in various key media events. He recently participated in ictQATAR's \"Media Connected\" forum for journalists in Qatar, where he discussed the concept of technology journalism around the world and how technology is expected to keep transforming the world of journalism in the Middle East and all around the world.<br /><br />-Wikipedia",

He also helped establish the Hemingway Society, which presents the annual Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award for the best first work of fiction published in the U.S., and organized its biannual conferences for Hemingway scholars. The professor was particularly delighted with the 1996 conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, one of Hemingway's familiar stomping grounds, which was attended by five friends of the late author.<br /><br />Internationally respected, Reynolds was consulted in 1992 about 20 newly discovered newspaper stories allegedly written by Hemingway for the Toronto Star in the early 1920s. Some of the articles, which Reynolds and other scholars authenticated, were found in the Hemingway section of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, the world's leading center of Hemingway studies.[<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/18/local/me-6720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">More...</a>]",

        "biography": "Christian Jacq is a French author and Egyptologist. He has written several novels about ancient Egypt, notably a five book suite about pharaoh Ramses II, a character whom Jacq admires greatly.<br /><br />Jacq's interest in Egyptology began when he was thirteen, and read <i>History of Ancient Egyptian Civilization</i> by Jacques Pirenne. This inspired him to write his first novel. He first visited Egypt when he was seventeen, went on to study Egyptology and archaeology at the Sorbonne, and is now one of the world's leading Egyptologists.<br /><br />By the time he was eighteen, he had written eight books. His first commercially successful book was Champollion the Egyptian, published in 1987. As of 2004 he has written over fifty books, including several non-fiction books on the subject of Egyptology.<br /><br />He and his wife later founded the Ramses Institute, which is dedicated to creating a photographic description of Egypt for the preservation of endangered archaeological sites.<br /><br />Between 1995-1997, he published his best selling five book suite Rams\u00e8s, which is today published in over twenty-five countries. Each volume encompasses one aspect of Ramesses' known historical life, woven into a fictional tapestry of the ancient world for an epic tale of love, life and deceit.<br /><br />Jacq's series describes a vision of the life of the pharaoh: he has two vile power-hungry siblings, Shanaar, his decadent older brother, and Dolora, his corrupted older sister who married his teacher. In his marital life, he first has Isetnofret (Iset) as a mistress (second Great Wife), meets his true love Nefertari (first Great Wife) and after their death, gets married to Maetnefrure in his old age. Jacq gives Ramesses only three biological children: Kha'emweset, Meritamen (she being the only child of Nefertari, the two others being from Iset) and Merneptah. The other \"children\" are only young officials trained for government and who are nicknamed \"sons of the pharaoh\".",

She has been nominated twice for the IACP Julia Child Cookbook Awards. Her books are all represented at the prestigious Culinary Collection of the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br /><br />When she isn't up to her elbows in flour, Beth is a monthly food columnist with the San Jose Mercury News \"Baking By the Seasons\".

Known for designing recipes with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and time-saving tips, she has been noted by Martha Stewart, Oprah Winfrey, and Patricia Wells for her cooking and home entertaining.<br /><br />Garten had no formal training; she taught herself culinary techniques with the aid of French and New England cookbooks. Later, she relied on intuition and feedback from customers and friends to refine her recipes. She was mentored chiefly by Eli Zabar, owner of Eli's Manhattan and Eli's Breads, and food-show host and author Martha Stewart. Among her dishes are c\u0153ur \u00e0 la creme, celery root remoulade, pear clafouti, and a simplified version of b\u0153uf bourguignon. Her culinary career began with her gourmet food store, Barefoot Contessa; Garten then expanded her activities to several best-selling cookbooks, magazine columns, self-branded convenience products, and a popular Food Network television show.<br />",

        "biography": "Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his father left them when Stephen was two, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of them. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.<br /><br />Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.<br /><br />He met Tabitha Spruce in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University, where they both worked as students; they married in January of 1971. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.<br /><br />Stephen made his first professional short story sale (\"The Glass Floor\") to <i>Startling Mystery Stories</i> in 1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many were gathered into the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10628.Night_Shift\" title=\"Night Shift\" rel=\"nofollow\">Night Shift</a> collection or appeared in other anthologies.<br /><br />In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching English at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels.",

Pondsmith is credited as author of several RPG lines, including Mekton (1984), Cyberpunk (1988) and Castle Falkenstein (1994). He also contributed to the Forgotten Realms and Oriental Adventures lines of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, worked in various capacities on video games and authored or co-created several board games. Pondsmith also worked as an instructor at the DigiPen Institute of Technology.<br /><br />Born in a military family, Pondsmith was traveling around the world with the U.S. Air Force for the first 18 years of his life. He graduated from the University of California, Davis achieving B.A. in graphic design and B.S. in psychology. Pondsmith recalls that he's been designing games even as a child but it wasn't until college where he got introduced to the idea of pen and paper roleplaying games when a friend of his got a copy of the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Having a lot of naval wargaming experience he got interested in the gameplay mechanics utilized by the D&amp;D but not in the fantasy setting presented. His interest spiked however when he acquired a copy of Traveller, a science fiction role-playing game, published in 1977 by Game Designers' Workshop. Dissatisfied with its mechanics, Pondsmith rewrote the game for his personal use under the name Imperial Star. Pondsmith later called Traveller the best roleplaying game he's encountered in the Green Ronin's award winning Hobby Games: The 100 Best.<br /><br />",

        "biography": "<b>Dan Simmons</b> grew up in various cities and small towns in the Midwest, including Brimfield, Illinois, which was the source of his fictional \"Elm Haven\" in 1991's SUMMER OF NIGHT and 2002's A WINTER HAUNTING. Dan received a B.A. in English from Wabash College in 1970, winning a national Phi Beta Kappa Award during his senior year for excellence in fiction, journalism and art. <br /><br />Dan received his Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis in 1971. He then worked in elementary education for 18 years\u20142 years in Missouri, 2 years in Buffalo, New York\u2014one year as a specially trained BOCES \"resource teacher\" and another as a sixth-grade teacher\u2014and 14 years in Colorado.<br /><br /> ABOUT DAN<br /> Biographic Sketch <br /><br />His last four years in teaching were spent creating, coordinating, and teaching in APEX, an extensive gifted/talented program serving 19 elementary schools and some 15,000 potential students. During his years of teaching, he won awards from the Colorado Education Association and was a finalist for the Colorado Teacher of the Year. He also worked as a national language-arts consultant, sharing his own \"Writing Well\" curriculum which he had created for his own classroom. Eleven and twelve-year-old students in Simmons' regular 6th-grade class averaged junior-year in high school writing ability according to annual standardized and holistic writing assessments. Whenever someone says \"writing can't be taught,\" Dan begs to differ and has the track record to prove it. Since becoming a full-time writer, Dan likes to visit college writing classes, has taught in New Hampshire's Odyssey writing program for adults, and is considering hosting his own Windwalker Writers' Workshop.<br /><br />Dan's first published story appeared on Feb. 15, 1982, the day his daughter, Jane Kathryn, was born. He's always attributed that coincidence to \"helping in keeping things in perspective when it comes to the relative importance of writing and life.\"<br /><br />Dan has been a full-time writer since 1987 and lives along the Front Range of Colorado\u2014in the same town where he taught for 14 years\u2014with his wife, Karen, his daughter, Jane, (when she's home from Hamilton College) and their Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Fergie. He does much of his writing at Windwalker\u2014their mountain property and cabin at 8,400 feet of altitude at the base of the Continental Divide, just south of Rocky Mountain National Park. An 8-ft.-tall sculpture of the Shrike\u2014a thorned and frightening character from the four Hyperion/Endymion novels\u2014was sculpted by an ex-student and friend, Clee Richeson, and the sculpture now stands guard near the isolated cabin.",

        "biography": "Dan Jurgens is an American comic book writer and artist. He is best known for creating the superhero Booster Gold, and for his lengthy runs on the Superman titles Adventures of Superman and Superman (vol. 2), particularly during The Death of Superman storyline. Other series he has been associated with include The Sensational Spider-Man (Vol. 1), Thor (vol. 2), Captain America (vol. 3), Justice League America, Metal Men, Teen Titans (vol. 2), Zero Hour, Tomb Raider: The Series, Aquaman (vol. 3), and the creator of DC Comics' imprint Tangent.<br /><br />Jurgens' first professional comic work was for DC Comics on Warlord #63. He was hired due to a recommendation of Warlord-series creator Mike Grell who was deeply impressed by Jurgens' work after being shown his private portfolio at a convention. In 1984, Jurgens was the artist for the Sun Devils limited series (July 1984 - June 1985), with writers Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas. Jurgens would make his debut as a comic book writer with Sun Devils he began scripting from Conway's plots with #8 and fully took over the writing duties on the title with #10. In 1985, Jurgens created the character Booster Gold, who became a member of the Justice League. His first work on Superman was as penciller for Adventures of Superman Annual #1 (1987). In 1989, Jurgens began working full-time on the character when he took over the writing/pencilling of the monthly Adventures of Superman.<br /><br />Dan Jurgens was the penciller of the 1990\u20131991 limited series Armageddon 2001 and co-created the hero Waverider with Archie Goodwin. In 1991 Jurgens assumed the writing/pencilling of the main Superman comic book, where he created a supporting hero named Agent Liberty. During his run on Superman, Dan created two major villains, Doomsday and the Cyborg. Doomsday was the main antagonist in the Death of Superman storyline. Jurgens wrote and drew Justice League America for about one year and in 1993 pencilled the Metal Men four-issue miniseries, which was a retcon of their origin story. Jurgens wrote and pencilled the 1994 comic book miniseries and crossover Zero Hour. He wrote and penciled layouts (with finished art by Brett Breeding) to the Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey miniseries, which was a follow-up to the successful Death of Superman storyline. In 1995 Jurgens and Italian artist Claudio Castellini worked on the highly publicized crossover Marvel vs DC. In the same year, he gave up the pencilling duties on Superman.<br /><br />Jurgens scripted and provided layout art for the Superman vs. Aliens miniseries. The story was about a battle between Superman and the aliens created by H. R. Giger (a.k.a. the Xenomorphs), from the Alien film series. It was co-published by Dark Horse Comics and DC Comics in 1995.<br /><br />In January 1996, Jurgens was writer and penciller of the new Spider-Man series, The Sensational Spider-Man (Vol. 1), at Marvel Comics. The title was initially conceived to be the flagship showcase for the new Ben Reilly Spider-Man (it replaced the Web of Spider-Man series). The initial seven issues (#0\u20136, January\u2013July 1996) were written and pencilled by Jurgens. Jurgens pushed strongly for the restoration of Peter Parker as the true Spider-Man and plans were made to enact this soon, but Bob Harras, the new Editor-in-chief, demanded the story be deferred until after the Onslaught crossover. Jurgens had by this stage become disillusioned with the immense amount of group planning and constant changes of ideas and directions and took this as the last straw, resigning from the title. In a past interview several years after his Spider-Man run, Jurgens stated that he would like to have another chance on the character, since his run was with the Ben Reilly character during the Spider-Man Clone Saga, and not Peter Parker. <br /><br />Jurgens had also written and pencilled Teen Titans (vol. 2) for its entire two year, 24 issue run. New Teen Titans co-creator George P\u00e9rez came on board on this incarnation of the Titans as inker for the se",

He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's <i>The Divine Comedy</i> and was one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets.<br /><br />Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine and studied at Bowdoin College. After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were <i>Voices of the Night</i> (1839) and <i>Ballads and Other Poems</i> (1842). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to focus on his writing, though he lived the remainder of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts in a former headquarters of George Washington.<br /><br />Longfellow predominantly wrote lyric poetry, known for its musicality, which often presented stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas. He has been criticized, however, for imitating European styles and writing specifically for the masses.<br />",
